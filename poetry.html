<h1 class="article-title">Poetry & Songs</h1>


<p>Here are a few poems and songs (which I didn’t write) that are beautiful in
form, content, or both (but not neither). They are not listed in any particular order.

</p><h2><p><i>His Be the Victor’s Name,</i> Samuel Whitelock Gandy</h2>

</p><p>With this song, Gandy demonstrates his rare understanding of the nature of
Christ’s victory over sin and death. I hope he also understood that we are
supposed to follow after Jesus’ example.

</p><div class="poemsong"><div class="poemsong-line">His be the Victor’s name,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">who fought the fight alone;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">triumphant saints no honor claim;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">His conquest was their own.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">By weakness and defeat</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">He won a glorious crown,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">trod all our foes beneath His feet</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">by being trodden down.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">He Satan’s pow’r laid low;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">made sin, He sin o’erthrew;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">bowed to the grave, destroyed it so,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">and death, by dying, slew.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Bless, bless the Conqu’ror slain,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">slain in His victory;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">who lived, who died, who lives again </div>
<div class="poemsong-line">for thee, His church, for thee!</div>
</div>

<h2><p><i>The Advocate,</i> Charitie Lees Smith</h2>

</p><p>This wonderful hymn pictures our legal status in the courtroom of
Heaven. Absolutely sends shivers down my spine. Written in 1863 according to
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitie_Lees_Smith">Wikipedia</a>.

</p><div class="poemsong"><div class="poemsong-line">Before the throne of God above,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">I have a strong and perfect plea,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">A great High Priest whose name is Love,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Who ever lives and pleads for me.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">My name is graven on His hands,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">My name is written on His heart.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">I know that while in heav’n He stands,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">No tongue can bid me thence depart,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">No tongue can bid me thence depart.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">When Satan tempts me to despair</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">And tells me of the guilt within,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Upward I look and see Him there,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Who made an end of all my sin.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Because the sinless Savior died,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">My sinful soul is counted free;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">For God the Just is satisfied</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">To look on Him and pardon me,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">To look on Him and pardon me.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Behold Him there, the risen Lamb,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">My perfect, spotless Righteousness,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">The great unchangeable I Am,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">The King of glory and of grace!</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">One with Himself, I cannot die.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">My soul is purchased by His blood!</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">My life is hid with Christ on high,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">With Christ my Savior and my God,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">With Christ my Savior and my God.</div>
</div>

<h2><p><i>It Is Well With My Soul,</i> Horatio Spafford</h2>

</p><p>This song was written by Spafford after his son died at the age of two, he was financially ruined by the Chicago fire of 1871, and his four daughters died in a shipwreck. He wrote it as the ship he was travelling on to meet his wife, who alone was pulled from the wreckage alive, passed near where it had gone down.

</p><div class="poemsong"><div class="poemsong-line">When peace like a river, attendeth my way,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">When sorrows like sea billows roll;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to know</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">It is well, it is well, with my soul.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Let this blest assurance control,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">And hath shed His own blood for my soul.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">My sin, not in part but the whole,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">If Jordan above me shall roll,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">But Lord, ‘tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">The sky, not the grave, is our goal;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">And Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">It is well, it is well, oh my soul!</div>
</div>

<h2><p><i>A Mighty Fortress is Our God,</i> Martin Luther</h2>

</p><p>Rare is the song that contains so much of the Gospel as this one.

</p><div class="poemsong"><div class="poemsong-line">A mighty fortress is our God,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">a bulwark never failing;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">our helper he, amid the flood</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">of mortal ills prevailing.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">For still our ancient foe</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">doeth seek to work us woe;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">his craft and power are great,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">and armed with cruel hate,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">on earth is not his equal.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Did we in our own strength confide,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">our striving would be losing,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">were not the right Man on our side,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">the Man of God’s own choosing.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Doest ask who that may be?</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Christ Jesus, it is he;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Lord Sabaoth his name,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">from age to age the same;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">and he must win the battle.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">And though this world, with devils filled,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">should threaten to undo us,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">we shall not fear, for God has willed</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">his truth to triumph through us.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">The prince of darkness grim,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">we tremble not for him;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">his rage we can endure,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">for lo! his doom is sure;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">one little word shall fell him.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">That Word above all earthly powers</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">no thanks to them abideth;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">the Spirit and the gifts are ours</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">through him who with us sideth.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Let goods and kindred go,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">this mortal life also;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">the body they may kill:</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">God’s truth abideth still;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">his kingdom is forever!</div>
</div>

<h2><p><i>The Lord into His Garden Comes</i>, Lowell Mason</h2>

</p><p>For performance, I particularly like the Tim Eriksen’s (though the version he
sings is unfortunately abbreviated), which can be found on YouTube.

</p><div class="poemsong"><div class="poemsong-line">The Lord into his garden comes,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">The spices yield a rich perfume,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">The lilies grow and thrive,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">The lilies grow and thrive.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Refreshing showers of grace divine,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">From Jesus flow to every vine,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">And make the dead revive,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">And make the dead revive.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">O that this dry and barren ground</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">In springs of water may abound,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">A fruitful soil become,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">A fruitful soil become.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">The desert blossoms as the rose</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">As Jesus conquers all his foes,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">And makes his people one,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">And makes his people one.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Come brethren you who love the Lord</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Who taste the sweetness of his word,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">In Jesus’ ways go on,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">In Jesus’ ways go on.</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Our troubles and our trials here</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Will only make us richer there</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">When we arrive at home,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">When we arrive at home.</div>
</div>

<h2><p><i>Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven,</i> W. B. Yeats</h2>

</p><p>Not going to lie, heard this one on the movie Equilibrium like everyone else.

</p><div class="poemsong"><div class="poemsong-line">Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Enwrought with golden and silver light,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">The blue and the dim and the dark cloths</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Of night and light and the half light,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">I would spread the cloths under your feet:</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">But I, being poor, have only my dreams;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">I have spread my dreams under your feet;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.</div>
</div>

<h2><p>Excerpt from <i>The Waste Land</i>, T. S. Eliot</h2>

</p><div class="poemsong"><div class="poemsong-line">What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">You cannot say, or guess, for you know only</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">And the dry stone no sound of water. Only</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">There is shadow under this red rock,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">And I will show you something different from either</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Your shadow at morning striding behind you</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">I will show you fear in a handful of dust.</div>
</div>

<p>(At the risk of spoiling the wonder by naming it: The beauty of this passage is
its whispered promises of sharing secrets of transcendent things wrapped in the
rugged imagery of the earthly, which all hits in the last sentence. I point this
out because I think the rest of <i>The Waste Land</i> unfortunately does not uphold
this level of quality. The other verses are a mixed bag of strangely unpoetic
language on one hand and weird subject matter on the other.

</p><p>Compare the above with one of the verses following it: “Madame Sosostris, famous
clairvoyante, Had a bad cold, nevertheless Is known to be the wisest woman in
Europe, With a wicked pack of cards.” Each phrase in this sentence, almost every
single word, is dissonant for me. In fact, it’s combinatorially offensive: not
only are the individual words bad but the combinations are also painful. Another
verse uses the word “tubers,” a singularly ugly word, to refer to the type of
plant. Maybe my expectations are wrong, but this kind of thing ruins the rest of
the poem for me&#8288;—&#8288;no doubt that this says more about me than Eliot’s work of
course.)

</p><h2><p><i>Ozymandius</i>, Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2>

</p><p>Yeah, it’s popular, but I never claimed to have original taste.

</p><div class="poemsong"><div class="poemsong-line">I met a traveller from an antique land,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Who said&#8288;—&#8288;“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Stand in the desert... Near them, on the sand,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Tell that its sculptor well those passions read</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">And on the pedestal, these words appear:</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Nothing beside remains. Round the decay</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare</div>
<div class="poemsong-line">The lone and level sands stretch far away.”</div>
