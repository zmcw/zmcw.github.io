<h1 class="article-title">The Surprising Usefulness of Romans 3:19</h1>


<p>Word for word, <a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=NKJV">Romans 3:19</a> is one of the most densely
packed scriptures in the New Testament. Its understated phrasing
disguises a rich vein of truths which are both generally informative
and also specifically relevant to several fundamental points of
Christian doctrine. This single sentence from the apostle Paul’s
largest surviving written work connects and crystalizes many
different understandings from all around the scripture into a
concise, easily digestible form. It reads like this:

</p><div class="scripture-block-quote"><div>
Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are
under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may
become guilty before God.
</div><div class="quote-attrib"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=NKJV">Romans 3:19</a>, NKJV</div></div>

<p>In these few short words, Paul makes no fewer than three strong
assertions about the nature of our relationship to God and the
Law. He addresses these questions, among others:

</p><ol><li>To whom does the Law speak?</li>
<li>What does the Law say to them?</li>
<li>Why does the Law say what it says?</li>
</ol>

<p>The verse answers these questions and grants us deep insights into
many of the major themes in Christian theology including Law, sin,
grace, and the gospel. Each part provides not just a truth in itself
but a tool to discover deeper truths, and functions as a guardrail to
keep us from erroneous understanding. As such, it is worth exploring
in greater detail.

</p>&nbsp;
<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=NKJV"><p>Romans 3:19</a> can be viewed as a three-part logical
assertion, and Paul frames the first part as if it were natural,
almost obvious to his readers: “Now we know that <i>whatever the law
says</i>, it says <i>to those who are under the law</i>...” And it does
sound almost self-evident in a way, so it’s easy to let this one slip
by without fully grasping the weight of it. The logical
“contrapositive” <a id="reference-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> of this first part
is actually so much more striking that we’ll focus on it instead of
the original formulation, and it is this: if whatever the Law says is
directed at those who are under it, then (𝟙) <b>the Law does not say
anything whatsoever to those who are not under it.</b>  This, combined
with the claim that “you [believers] are not under law but under
grace” from a few chapters later in <a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A14&version=NIV">6:14</a> gives
us the corollary that (𝟙.𝕒) <b>the Law has nothing whatsoever to say
to believers.</b>

</p><p>These two statements have implications that might be controversial in some
circles. For example, many Reformed or Calvinist theologians (and to a
perhaps-lesser extent, Lutheran ones) hold that the Law has three uses: one, as
a “curb” to prevent the people of the world from doing evil, via the pangs of
conscience (also called the “civil use”); two, as a “mirror,” to show us that we
are sinners (the “pedagogical use”); and three, as a “guide,” to show Christians
how to live (the “didactic use”) <a id="reference-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>. But this third use of the Law requires that the Law speak to
Christians, which is forbidden by (𝟙.𝕒). So, in my view, the three-uses theory
is incompatible with scripture.

</p><p>But even to those who are not members of the groups mentioned above, these
statements are very surprising, to put it mildly; it’s completely natural to
think that the Law should play some continuing role in our lives. But though
our theorem is surprising, it’s not completely unforeshadowed by what
information we already have.

</p><p>Let’s remember what the Law actually is. The Law is not a collection of moral
principles like “do not steal,” “do not kill,” etc. Rather, the Law is these,
bundled together with a consequence for breaking them.  We know this from
<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A5&version=NIV">Romans 10:5</a>, which says, “Moses writes this about the
righteousness that is by the law: ‘The person who does these things will live by
them.’” In other words, the righteousness of the Law is fundamentally of the
form “do <i>X</i> and live,” for some command X (and by implication, “fail to do
<i>X</i> and die”).  The Law spells out its punishment in
<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+18%3A20&version=ESV">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, “The soul who sins shall die,” echoed in
<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A23&version=KJV">Romans 6:23</a>, “The wages of sin is death.” This <i>if-then</i>
structure is essential to the nature of any law, not just the spiritual
one. Even the speed limit on a public road is not a law just because it says
“Don’t drive over sixty.” It’s a law because it says, <i>“If</i> you drive over
sixty, <i>then</i> you will get a fine.”  Without a consequent, what you have is a
suggestion or recommendation or something, but not a law. And it’s important to
keep this precise definition in mind, because otherwise we end up thinking
things like “the Law is repeated in the New Testament” <a id="reference-3" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>, or “Jesus kept the Law” <a id="reference-4" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>, or
something similar, and we get into some situations that, I believe, are
difficult to justify scripturally.

</p><p>So with the right definition in mind, it should make sense that the
Law has nothing to say to Christians, as the very thing that makes
the Law a “law,” namely the penalty of death, was already spent on
Christ, and is incapable of being applied to us now.  And the rest of
the scripture confirms this wonderful&#8288;—&#8288;but yes,
strange&#8288;—&#8288;state of affairs. Paul writes, for example, “Likewise,
my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ
[...] <sup class="superscript">6</sup>[and] now we are released from the law, having died to
that which held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the
Spirit and not in the old way of the written code”
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A4-6&version=NKJV">Romans 7:4-6</a>).  The Law does not speak to the dead;
the dead are no longer under the Law’s <i>juris-diction,</i> which word
comes from two Latin components literally meaning “law-speak.”  Who
ever heard of putting a dead man on trial?  Furthermore, how could
that which is not of faith (“and the law is not of faith,”
<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A12&version=ESV">Galatians 3:12</a>) have anything to add to us, to whom
“whatsoever is not of faith is sin” (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+14%3A23&version=KJV">Romans 14:23</a>)?
That’s worth saying again: whatsoever is not of faith is sin, and the
Law&#8288;—&#8288;remember, “<i>do</i> thus and so for righteousness”&#8288;—&#8288;is not
of faith. This <i>doing</i> of the Law is the very opposite of faith,
because the opposite of faith is fact: “Faith is the substance of
things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen”
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%3A1&version=NKJV">Hebrews 11:1</a>). So if you can see it (like you can see
me <i>doing</i> the Law), then it’s not “of faith.”  The righteousness
we have in Christ, on the other hand, is actually invisible because
it’s in the future. For now, I still look like a sinner to an
uninformed observer <a id="reference-5" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>. Paul says
that we “eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope”
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A5&version=NIV">Galatians 5:5</a>). And if we hope for righteousness, then
we certainly don’t possess it already, because “hope that is seen is
no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have?”
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A24&version=NIV">Romans 8:24</a>). Yet God calls those things which are not
as though they were (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A17&version=NIV">4:17</a>), and bids me do the
same, right in the middle of my squalor. It is for this reason that I
can say, “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,
but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I
live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself
for me” (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://studybible.info/AKJV/Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</a>). And we behold with unveiled
face the righteousness of God, which is now revealed to us apart from
the Law (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A20-21&version=KJV">Romans 3:20-21</a>).

</p><a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A4&version=KJV"><p>Galatians 5:4</a> says, “Christ is become of no effect unto
you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from
grace,” and the statement in (𝟙) is perfect for defying the gravity
of the Law. Any attempts to reintroduce elements of the
Law&#8288;—&#8288;which attempts are often adapted to sound well-meaning and
reasonable to our Law-based sensibilities, e.g. “Well, if so-and-so
were <i>really</i> a Christian, then they wouldn’t have done that,” or
the perennial favorite, “repent and <i>turn</i> from your sins, sister,
and God will forgive you”&#8288;—&#8288;should be countered flatly with a
recitation of (𝟙).

</p>&nbsp;
<p>The second tool <a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=NKJV">Romans 3:19</a> equips us with concerns
the purpose of the Law: “whatever the law says, it says ... that
every mouth may be <i>stopped</i>, and all the world may become
<i>guilty</i> before God.” We already learned that the Law only speaks
to those under the Law, not to Christians. But this part informs us
that, even when it’s speaking to non-Christians, (𝟚) <b>the Law says
what it says it to condemn you before God.</b> In other words, the Law’s
purpose is to bring its audience to muted guilt for their sins
against it. But, critically, Paul uses the words “<i>whatever</i>
[<a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/greek/hosa_3745.htm">𝐆𝟑𝟕𝟒𝟓 ὅσα</a> “hosa,”
<i>whatever, everything, all]</i> the law says.” This means that
condemnation is not just one of several purposes of the Law, but
rather it is the Law’s one and only purpose. This leads us to state
that (𝟚.𝕒) <b>the Law has no other purpose than to condemn you.</b>

</p><p>This second axiom contradicts the designation of the Law as a “curb”
to restrain evil in the world. This in itself is rather bizarre;
doesn’t God want people to do good? But as if that weren’t enough, it
turns out that the whole purpose of the Law from the very beginning
was actually to make sin abound! “Now the law entered in, that sin
might abound...”  (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A20&version=DRA">Romans 5:20</a>, first part). Far from
being a bane to evil, the Law is actually the strength of sin!  “The
sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law” (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1
Corinthians+15%3A56&version=NKJV">1
Corinthians 15:56</a>). Paul describes the dire state of affairs
in Romans 7:

</p><div class="scripture-block-quote"><div><sup class="laligned superscript">7</sup>What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it
had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not
have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall not
covet.”</div><div><sup class="laligned superscript">8</sup>But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in
me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead.</div><div><sup class="laligned superscript">9</sup>I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment
came, sin came alive and I died.</div><div><sup class="laligned superscript">10</sup>The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.</div><div><sup class="laligned superscript">11</sup>For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me
and through it killed me.</div><div class="quote-attrib"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A7-11&version=ESV">Romans 7:7-11</a>, ESV</div></div>

<p>So there is no answer to “Doesn’t God want people to do good?” because the
question itself is fallacious. For the unredeemed world, “good” in the only
relevant sense is a property of a <i>person</i> which is inherited by their
actions, not a property of actions which is inherited by the person. In other
words, we are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are sinners, having
inherited a sinful nature from Adam (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A12-21&version=NIV">Romans 5:12-21</a>), and our
actions flow from that <a id="reference-6" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>. We are revealed to be not just partially but completely
bereft of this property of goodness on the first sign of evil manifesting in us,
because if we break a single part of the Law, we are guilty of all: “For whoever
keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it”
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A10&version=ESV">James 2:10</a>). Nothing we can do can restore this goodness, and
attempting to do so only amplifies how far short we have fallen of
perfection. Rather than saying that God wanted us to <i>do</i> good or evil, we
must say that God wanted us to <i>be</i> good and not evil. But since we are
incapable of being good in ourselves, He desired to show us how evil we already
are by magnifying that evil in our sight. He created and gave us the Law to do
this magnification: “...in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and
<i>through the commandment</i> might become sinful beyond measure”
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A13&version=ESV">Romans 7:13</a>, emph. added).

</p><p>Thus, the sole and simple purpose of the Law is to indict and convict us for the
capital offense of <i>being</i> sinners. The Law never speaks to us to tell us that
we are correct or righteous, because we are never correct or righteous; nor does
it speak to us to convince us to change, because we can never change in its
eyes. It hears no excuses, it brooks no defenses, it gives no second chances, it
accepts only guilty silence. Its only goal is to crush all hope of keeping it,
so that we perceive the reality of our situation and stop searching for
righteousness inside ourselves. Its singular aim is to finally wring out of us,
after all our best attempts have failed, one last cry, one last desperate gasp
for air: “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
death?” (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A24&version=NKJV">Romans 7:24</a>).

</p><p>But in a strange and wonderful twist, God transformed what would have been our
sure damnation into an integral part of the mechanism for our salvation:
“...where sin abounded, grace did more abound” (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A20&version=DRA">Romans 5:20</a>,
second part)! So the sequence is this: where the Law is strong, sin abounds. But
where sin abounds, grace superabounds. And where grace superabounds, love
abounds; for who is forgiven much loves much, and who is forgiven little loves
little (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+7%3A47&version=ESV">Luke 7:47</a>). This journey from Law to sin to grace to love
is the road that every Christian takes to Christ. Look at Paul: Pharisee of
Pharisees, of the tribe of Benjamin, circumcised the eighth day, zealous
persecutor of the Church, defender of the Law. But the harder he worked to keep
the Law, the more material there was for Sin to use against him
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A7-24&version=ESV">Romans 7:7-24</a>). This alone compelled him to listen when Christ
came calling. And for this critical role that it plays in our salvation, Paul
gave the Law a new name in <a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A24-25&version=KJV">Galatians 3:24-25</a>: “the law was our
schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.” Then
he adds, “But after that faith is come, <i>we are no longer under a
schoolmaster”</i> (emph. added). When it comes to the Law, our only hope is to die,
so that we can be raised with Christ.

</p><p>Someone might say that the Law doesn’t actually create the sin, it just shows
you what’s already there. And that’s where I do agree with the Lutheran
viewpoint. The Law does make a superb mirror to show you how wretched you are:
“for by the law is the knowledge of sin” (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A20&version=NKJV">Romans 3:20</a>). The
mirror doesn’t create the dirt you see on your face, of course. But this doesn’t
change the fact that the mirror has only one function. Any restraint from evil
this produces in you is an accident, and insofar as it fosters any sense of
accomplishment or righteousness, it is actually contrary to the Law’s stated
purpose. The Law is not your friend: “for the law works wrath”
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://studybible.info/AKJV/Romans 4:15">4:15</a>). Dante wrote that above the gates of Hell the words
are inscribed, <span class="smallcaps">All hope abandon, ye who enter here.</span> But these words are
perhaps just as appropriate for the entrance to the temple of the Law.

</p><p>The statement in (𝟚) is useful any time the Law is used for the wrong thing. For
example, it is held by some that the Ten Commandments, representing the Law,
should be used as a political device, to guide lawmakers and to stand watch over
our courthouses and state capitol buildings (see
<a id="reference-7" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>,
<a id="reference-8" href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>,
<a id="reference-9" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>,
and many others). But the Law is not suitable for these purposes.  A human court
must sometimes find the defendant innocent, but the Law always enters the same
judgment: guilty.

</p>

<p>Another enlightening result of (𝟚), again courtesy of the
contrapositive, is that (𝟚.𝕓) <b>if what you’re hearing isn’t
condemning you, then it isn’t the Law.</b>  So when Jesus told the woman
caught in the act of adultery, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin
no more” (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A11&version=NKJV">John 8:11</a>), He can’t have been teaching the
Law, as His words weren’t condemning her. Similarly, when Paul
writes, “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus” (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A1&version=NIV">Romans 8:1</a>), he is stating that there is
no room for the Law in Christ Jesus. And again, when the scripture
says, “For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the
world, but that the world through Him might be saved”
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A17&version=NKJV">John 3:17</a>), it tells us that Jesus didn’t come to
deliver the Law, because the Law only condemns. (It’s almost like
Jesus said, “I didn’t come into the world to condemn the world,” and
the Law says, “I came into the world to condemn the world!”)

</p>&nbsp;
<p>The third tool we find in <a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=NKJV">Romans 3:19</a> is a bit more niche, but no
less powerful than the others. Principle (𝟙) states that the Law speaks only to
those under it. But, we might ask, who is under it? The verse reads, “whatever
the law says, it says ... that <i>every</i> mouth may be stopped, and <i>all the
world</i> may become guilty before God.” Since Paul uses the words “all the world,”
we can infer that (𝟛) <b>everyone begins under the Law.</b> That is to say,
everyone feels compunction by the condemnation of the Law, so that no one can
claim ignorance.

</p><p>This one might seem less revolutionary than our previous discussions. But I
think that (𝟛) is nicely suited for understanding how we, as completely sinful
human beings, can even comprehend or think valuable the good and holy things God
offers us. Some say that we are incapable of doing so, that humanity lives by
default in a state of “total depravity,” unable to even desire salvation until
we are individually selected by God and receive the desire to believe from
Him. But I think what they miss is that, while we are indeed totally depraved,
we also have the Law written on our hearts. <a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://studybible.info/AKJV/Romans 2:14-15">Romans 2:14-15</a> says,
“For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things
contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:
<sup class="superscript">15</sup>Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience
also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing
one another.” In other words, even unsaved non-Jews, who weren’t directly given
the Ten Commandments by God like the Jews, still know right from wrong. They and
we, both Jew and non-, have the requirements of the Law written on the heart, if
not on tablets of stone; and we all demonstrate this by making moral accusations
(usually of others) and excuses (usually for ourselves). Not everyone has the
exact same laws, not everyone’s conscience pricks them for the same things. They
differ across countries, cultures, religions, and even periods of time. But
everyone has that essential “Do <i>X</i> or else, don’t do <i>Y</i> or else.” For the
Law to achieve its goal, the precise contents of its dicta are irrelevant; it is
the form that stays consistent. And we always end up condemned, one way or
another <a id="reference-10" href="#footnote-10">[10]</a>.

</p><p>So the Law is actually the bridge between us, who are carnal, and God, who is
spiritual. Despite the facts that “there is none righteous, no, not one”
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A10&version=NKJV">Romans 3:10</a>), and that, “in my flesh there dwells no good thing”
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A18&version=NKJV">7:18</a>), we still have this piece stuck inside
us&#8288;—&#8288;“written on our hearts”&#8288;—&#8288;which is itself spiritual: “We know that
the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin”
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A14&version=NIV">7:14</a>). This piece acts as the “sensor” that attunes us to
the offer of the Gospel. It’s how we feel guilt, and how we even know we need a
savior. And according to (𝟛), that’s built into everyone, no special selection
from God required. If we give up this idea, then we also have to abandon the
idea that all the world will become guilty before God according to the Law,
because “sin is not imputed where there is no law” (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A13&version=NASB">5:13</a>),
and “where there is no law there is no transgression”
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A15&version=NIV">4:15</a>). Therefore we must rule in favor of (𝟛), that the
Law is active in everyone (until we come to Christ&#8288;—&#8288;that is, in everyone
until we die, again quoting <a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A4-6&version=NKJV">7:4-6</a>).

</p><p>This understanding is reconfirmed by Christ himself, when he
instructed the disciples just before his ascension: “Go into all the
world and preach the gospel to every creature...”
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16%3A15&version=NKJV">Mark 16:15</a>). The gospel “good news” is the solution
to a certain problem, which is that you are condemned by the Law. If
we are meant to offer the solution to that problem to “all the
world,” then we know that all the world already has that
problem. Otherwise, Christ would have had to charge us essentially
with creating the problem first by preaching the Law (because as we
read in <a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A13&version=NASB">Romans 5:13</a>, “sin is not imputed where there
is no Law”), and then preaching the gospel only afterward. So it
won’t do to say that we should preach the Law to non-Christians,
because all the world is already laboring under it, per (𝟛). <a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2
Corinthians+3%3A6&version=NIV">2
Corinthians 3:6</a> confirms our calling, away from preaching the
Law and towards preaching the Spirit: “[God] has made us competent as
ministers of a new covenant&#8288;—&#8288;not of the letter [written on
tablets of stone] but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the
Spirit gives life.” We are not made ministers of death, but of
life. Moses is at work in the world, and his ministry is not ours to
take up.

</p><p>Now, people may react to the accusations of the Law in different
ways. Some people respond by pointing out all the good they have done
on the contrary, and promising to do more. Others, by crying out for
mercy. But everyone has this spiritual sense nonetheless. For this
reason we can earnestly proclaim that Jesus died for the whole world,
that God’s offer of salvation is to everyone, that anyone who wants
to be saved will be saved, and we can be confident that the Law is
attempting to prepare people’s hearts to hear just this message. We
just need to step back and let the schoolmaster do its work.

</p>&nbsp;
<p>In conclusion, here are the statements we’ve been able to glean from
<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=NKJV">Romans 3:19</a>:

</p><div class="customlist"><div><span class="laligned">𝟙)&nbsp;</span>The Law does not say anything whatsoever to those who are not
under it.</div>
<div><span class="laligned">𝟙.𝕒)&nbsp;</span>The Law has nothing whatsoever to say to Christians.</div>
<div><span class="laligned">𝟚)&nbsp;</span>The Law says what it says it to condemn you before God.</div>
<div><span class="laligned">𝟚.𝕒)&nbsp;</span>The Law has no other purpose than to condemn you.</div>
<div><span class="laligned">𝟚.𝕓)&nbsp;</span>If what you’re hearing isn’t condemning you, then it isn’t the
Law.</div>
<div><span class="laligned">𝟛)&nbsp;</span>Everyone begins under the Law.</div>
</div>

<p>I believe that, as Christians still struggling with sin and still
grappling with the Law that is etched on our hearts, we are
constantly tempted to do as Peter suggested in
<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+17%3A4&version=KJV">Matthew 17:4</a> and build three monuments&#8288;—&#8288;one to
Jesus, one to Moses, and one to Elijah. Our Law-filled hearts tell us
that it is fitting to hear the words of the Law or the Prophets
alongside those of Christ. But studying scriptures like
<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=KJV">Romans 3:19</a> helps us reply to our hearts as God replied
to Peter upon hearing the suggestion: this is God’s beloved Son; hear
<i>Him,</i> not Moses or Elijah. Christ is sufficient in Himself.

</p><p>As I’ve hoped to show, this short verse in Romans is an essential
scripture in anyone’s repertoire. It compactly tells us not only to
whom the law speaks, but to whom it doesn’t speak; not only what the
law says, but what it doesn’t say. In sheer information density it
rivals the best, and it sits at a busy intersection between so many
of the strange and alien ideas we find in the scriptures which seem
so foreign to our minds. Although it keeps a low profile, on the
scale of usefulness it ranks with the likes of “God justifies the
ungodly,” “I rejoice in my infirmities,” and “Faith works by love,”
if not “The just shall live by faith.” These are all certainly words
to keep close at hand.

statement is obtained by reversing it and negating both sides: the
contrapositive of “If <i>A</i>, then <i>B</i>” is “If not <i>B</i>, then not
<i>A</i>.” For example, the contrapositive of “If it rained, then it is
wet outside” is “If it is not wet outside, then it did not rain.” The
special property of a contrapositive is that if an assertion is true,
then its contrapositive is always true as well.</span>

</div><div id="footnote-3" class="footnote">
<span class="footnote-num"><a href="#reference-3">3</a>.&nbsp;</span><span class="footnote-text">Though it may
seem like it, if we remember the definition of “Law” I believe we can see that
the Law is not “repeated” in the sense of being re-established in the New
Testament; <a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4%3A28&version=NKJV">Ephesians 4:28</a>’s “Let him who stole steal no more”
lacks the Law’s consequent “or die,” and the same can be said about Christ’s “Go
and sin no more” to the woman caught in the act of adultery, and all the rest,
so these by definition can’t be the Law.</span>
</div><div id="footnote-4" class="footnote">
<span class="footnote-num"><a href="#reference-4">4</a>.&nbsp;</span><span class="footnote-text">To
“keep” something in this sense means to conform to it or behave according to it;
but the Law is a shadow of Christ (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10%3A1&version=NIV">Hebrews 10:1</a>), and it cannot be
said that a man conforms to his shadow, or behaves according to his shadow. The
subject is a bit too large to fully address here, but rather than either keeping
or “breaking” the Law (as if a man could “break” his shadow), Christ
<i>fulfilled</i> the Law (see <a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A17&version=NIV">Matthew 5:17</a>,
<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A4&version=ESV">Romans 10:4</a>), being that which the Law was modeled from (and much
more), such that the Law passes away in Christ (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A18&version=NIV">Matthew 5:18</a>), or
in other words, such that the Law is unnecessary in Christ, just as it is not
necessary to study the shadow of a man any longer when he himself is present
with you. The writer of Hebrews demonstrates that Christ is the high priest of a
new covenant with a new Law (“For when the priesthood is changed, the law must
be changed also,” <a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+7%3A12&version=NIV">Hebrews 7:12</a>). This makes sense intuitively,
since a priest of one system is not subject to the law of another system (and
especially not a system that is inferior&#8288;—&#8288;c.f. Hebrews’ descriptions of a
“better covenant” with “better promises,” etc). Saying that Christ kept the Law
is like saying that the movement of the trees makes the wind blow, or that the
time keeps the clock. On the contrary, Christ did not “keep” or conform to his
shadow in the Law, but instead the Law conforms to (a fraction of the fullness
of) Christ, as a shadow conforms to the man. Jesus didn’t look at the Law to
figure out what he should do; rather, the Law looked at Jesus, so to speak, to
decide what it should say. The fact that the Law reaches the end of its intended
lifespan in Christ is elaborated in <a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A16-19&version=ESV">Galatians 3:16-19</a>
(emph. added): “Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It
does not say, ‘And to offsprings,’ referring to many, but referring to one, ‘And
to your offspring,’ who is Christ. [...] <sup class="superscript">19</sup>Why then the law? It was added
because of transgressions, <i>until the offspring [Christ] should come</i> to whom
the promise had been made...” And it is confirmed by Jesus himself, who said,
<i>“The law and the prophets were until John.</i>  Since that time the kingdom of
God has been preached, and everyone is pressing into it”
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+16%3A16&version=NKJV">Luke 16:16</a>, emph. added). (To clarify, this verse indicates that
the kingdom began to be preached (by Christ) <i>after</i> John, that is, after the
law and the prophets, because John was not part of this kingdom of God,
according to Jesus in <a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11%3A11&version=NIV">Matthew 11:11</a>: “Truly I tell you, among
those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist;
yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.”  Naturally,
if one is less than the least of a group, then one is not part of that
group. Rather, John was the greatest prophet of the old covenant.)</span>

</div><div id="footnote-6" class="footnote">
<span class="footnote-num"><a href="#reference-6">6</a>.&nbsp;</span><span class="footnote-text">And accordingly, Christ was not “good” because
He did good; rather, He did good because He was good, and His actions flowed
from that. This is why the righteousness of God is now revealed to us without
reference to the Law (<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A21&version=KJV">Romans 3:21</a>) at all! Indeed, the
righteousness of God is revealed to us to be the very person Jesus Christ
(<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1 Corinthians+1%3A30&version=KJV">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>). In fact, I believe that this conflation of
personal good and “ergometric” good (i.e. measuring the goodness of works) is
the issue that Jesus took with the rich young man in verse 17 of
<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A16-22&version=KJV">Matthew 19:16-22</a>. The young man calls Jesus “good master” to which
Jesus replies, “Why do you call me good?” He identifies that the man is calling
Him “good” not because of <i>who</i> he believed Christ was, i.e. that He was the
Son of God and Savior of the world (as evidenced by the fact that the young man
ends up choosing his wealth over company with this “teacher” Jesus), but because
of <i>what</i> he had observed that Christ had done in His ministry and heard of
Him by reputation, etc. Jesus states that “There is none good but God” as if to
say, “If you don’t think that I am the Christ and the Son of God, then don’t
call me good,” showing the primacy that one’s identity has over the outworking
of that identity.</span>
