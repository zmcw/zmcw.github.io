Word for word, Romans 3:19 is one of the most densely packed verses in
the New Testament. Upon close inspection, it proves to be rich,
teeming with axioms for proving doctrinal arguments. The verse states
with dispositive authority what other scriptures might leave open to
interpretation. It reads like this:

\bverse{Romans}{3}{19}{NKJV}{
Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are
under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may
become guilty before God.
}

In just these few short words, Paul makes no fewer than three strong
assertions about the nature of our relationship to God and the
Law. This one verse compactly addresses these questions:

\olist
{To whom does the Law speak?}
{What does the Law say to them?}
{Why does the Law say what it says?}
{:end}

The answers grant us deep insights into Law, Sin, Grace, and the
Gospel, and their clarity, brevity, and unequivocality make them ideal
building blocks for proving larger theories and resolving doctrinal
contentions that arise on these subjects. Each one acts as a tool to
discover deeper truths, and as a guardrail to keep us from erroneous
understanding. It is worth exploring them in detail.

Paul frames the first tool he gives us as being natural, almost
obvious: "Now we know that \i{whatever the law says}, it says \i{to those who
are under the law}..." (emph. added). And it does sound almost tautological in a way,
so it's easy to let this one slip by without fully grasping the weight
of it. The contrapositive is actually so much more striking that we'll
prefer it over the original formulation, and it is this: if whatever
the Law says is directed at those who are under it, then (ùüô) \b{the
Law does not say anything whatsoever to those who are not under it.}
This, combined with the claim that "you [believers] are not under law
but under grace" from a few chapters later in Romans 6:14 gives us the
corollary (ùüô.ùïí) that \b{the law has nothing whatsoever to say to
Christians.}

This statement would be quite controversial in some circles. Martin
Luther, for example, famously asserted that the Law has three uses:
one, as a "curb," to prevent people from doing evil, via the pangs of
conscience; two, as a "mirror," to show us that we are sinners; and
three, as a "guide," to show Christians how to live \footnote{See
\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_Gospel#Book_of_Concord}
for a brief overview.}. But this third use of the Law is disproved by
(ùüô.ùïí), because it directly contradicts the notion that the Law does
not speak to Christians. Should we be surprised? Yes!  It's very
natural to think that the Law should play some continuing role in our
lives, because, as we'll discuss later, we operate by default within
the Law's frame of reference (Romans 2:15). We always fall back to the
mode of making accusations and defenses, keeping an account of the
works we have done and we have earned by them, and we have to work
hard to break free of that.  But surprising though our theorem is,
it's not completely unforeshadowed by what information we already
have.

Let's remember what the Law actually is: the Law is not a collection
of moral principles like "do not steal," "do not kill," etc. Rather,
the Law is these, bundled together with a consequence for breaking
them.  We know this from Romans 10:5, which says, "Moses writes this
about the righteousness that is by the law: 'The person who does these
things will live by them.'" In other words, the righteousness of the
Law is fundamentally of the form "do \i{X} and live," for some command
X (and by implication, "fail to do \i{X} and die").  The Law spells
out its punishment in Ezekiel 18:20, "The soul who sins shall die,"
echoed in Romans 6:23, "The wages of sin is death." This if-then
structure is essential to the nature of any law; without it, what you
have is a suggestion or recommendation or something, but not a
law. And it's important to keep this precise definition in mind,
because otherwise we end up thinking things like the Law is repeated
in the New Testament \footnote{It's not; Ephesians 4:28's "Let him who
stole steal no more" lacks the Law's consequent "or die," and the same
can be said about Christ's "Go and sin no more" to the woman caught in
the act of adultery, and all the rest, so these by definition can't be
the Law.}, or that Jesus kept the Law \footnote{He didn't; the Law is
a shadow of Christ, and how can a man "keep" his shadow? Rather, He
\i{fulfilled} the Law, being that which the Law was modeled from (and
much more).}, or some such thing, and the entire doctrine of the New
Testament degenerates into incoherence.

So with the right definition in mind, it should make sense that the
Law has nothing to say to Christians, as the very thing that makes the
Law a "law," namely the penalty of death, was already spent on Christ,
is incapable of reaching us now.  And the rest of the scripture
confirms this wonderful\---{}but yes, strange\---{}state of
affairs. For example, Paul writes, "Therefore, my brethren, you also
have become dead to the law through the body of Christ [...]
\sup{6}Now we are released from the law, having died to that which
held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not
in the old way of the written code" (Romans 7:4, 6).  Obviously, the
Law does not speak to the dead; the dead are no longer under the Law's
\i{juris-diction,} which word comes from two Latin components
literally meaning "law-speak."  Who ever heard of putting a dead man
on trial?  Furthermore, how could that which is not of faith ("and the
law is not of faith," Galatians 3:12) have anything to add to us, to
whom "whatsoever is not of faith is sin" (Romans 14:23)? That's worth
saying again: whatsoever is not of faith is sin, and the
Law\---{}remember, "\i{do} thus and so for righteousness"\---{}is not
of faith. This \i{doing} of the Law is the very opposite of faith,
because the opposite of faith is fact: "Faith is the evidence of
things not seen" (Hebrews 11:1). So if you can see it (like you can
see me \i{doing} the law), then it's not "of faith."  The
righteousness we have in Christ, on the other hand, is actually
invisible because it's in the future; for now, I still look like a
sinner to an uninformed observer (c.f. the comforting words in 1 John
2:1, "My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you
may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the
Father, Jesus Christ the righteous..."). Yet God calls those things
which are not as though they were (Romans 4:17), and bids me do the
same, right in the middle of my squalor. That's the reason it can even
be called "righteousness \i{by faith.}"

Galatians 5:4 says, "Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever
of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from grace," and the
statement in (ùüô) is a readymade for defying the gravity of the
Law. Any attempts to reintroduce elements of the Law\---{}which attempts
are often disguised to sound well-meaning and reasonable to our
Law-based sensibilities, e.g. "Well, if so-and-so were \i{really} a
Christian, then they wouldn't have done that," or the perennial
favorite, "repent and turn from your sins, sister, and God will
forgive you"\---{}should be countered flatly with a recitation of (ùüô).

The second tool Romans 3:19 equips us with concerns the purpose of the
Law: "whatever the law says, it says ... that every mouth may be
\i{stopped}, and all the world may become \i{guilty} before God"
(emph. added). We knew that the Law only speaks to those under the
Law, not to Christians. But this part informs us that, even when it's
speaking to non-Christians, (ùüö) \b{whatever the Law says, it says it
to condemn you before God.} In other words, the Law's purpose is to
bring its audience to muted guilt for their sins against it. And
critically, Paul uses the words "\i{whatever} the law says." This
implies that (ùüö.ùüô) \b{the Law has no other purpose than to condemn
you.} It never speaks to you to tell you that you are correct or
righteous, because you are never correct or righteous; nor does it
speak to you to convince you to change, because you can never
change. It hears no excuses, it brooks no defenses, it gives no second
chances, it accepts only guilty silence.

This second axiom contradicts Martin Luther's designation of the Law
as a "curb" to restrain the evil in the world. But as if that weren't
enough, it turns out that the whole purpose of the Law from the very
beginning was actually to make sin abound! "Now the law entered in,
that sin might abound..." (Romans 5:20, first part). Far from being
a bane to evil, the Law is actually the strength of sin! "The sting of
death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law" (1 Corinthians
15:56). Paul describes the dire state of affairs in Romans 7:

\multiverse{Romans}{7:7-11}{ESV}
{7}
{What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it
had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not
have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, "You shall not
covet."}
{8}
{But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in
me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead.}
{9}
{I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment
came, sin came alive and I died.}
{10}
{The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.}
{11}
{For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me
and through it killed me.}
{:end}

The Law is not your friend: "for the law works wrath" (Romans
4:15). But in a strange and wonderful twist, God transformed what
would have been our sure damnation into an integral part of the
mechanism for our salvation: "...where sin abounded, grace did more
abound" (Romans 5:20, second part). Someone might say that the Law
doesn't actually create the sin, it just shows you what's already
there. And that's where Martin Luther and I agree. The Law does make a
superb mirror to show you how wretched you are: "for by the Law is the
knowledge of sin" (Romans 3:20). The mirror doesn't create the dirt
you see on your face, of course. But this doesn't change the fact that
the Law's sole and simple purpose is to indict and convict you for the
capital offense of being a sinner. Any restraint from evil this
produces in you is an accident, and insofar as it fosters any sense of
accomplishment or righteousness, it is actually contrary to the Law's
stated purpose: to crush all hope of keeping it, so that you perceive
the reality of your situation, and, possibly, start searching for
righteousness outside of yourself; to finally wring out of you, after
all your best attempts have failed, one last cry, one last desperate
gasp for air: "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the
body of this death?" (Romans 7:24). Dante wrote that above the gates
of Hell the words are inscribed, "All hope abandon, ye who enter
here." But these words are perhaps just as appropriate for the
entrance to the temple of the Law.

So the sequence is this: where the Law is strong, sin abounds. But
where sin abounds, grace superabounds. And where grace superabounds,
love abounds; for who is forgiven much loves much (Luke 7:47). This
journey from Sin to Law to Grace to Love is the road that every
Christian takes to Christ. Look at Paul: Pharisee of Pharisees, of the
tribe of Benjamin, circumcised the eighth day, zealous persecutor of
the Church, defender of the Law. But the harder he worked to keep the
Law, the more material Sin had to use against him. This ended up
compelling him to seek Grace, and he found it in Christ. For the
critical role it plays in our salvation, namely, driving us to look
for grace, Paul gave the Law a new name in Galatians 3:24-25: "the law
was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be
justified by faith." Then he adds, "But after that faith is come,
\i{we are no longer under a schoolmaster"} (emph. added). When it
comes to the Law, our only hope is to die, so that we can be raised
with Christ.

(ùüö) is useful any time people try to use the Law for the wrong
thing. For example, some people think that the Ten Commandments should
be used as a political device, to guide lawmakers or to stand watch
over our courthouses and state capitol buildings (see
\footnote{\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments_Monument_(Oklahoma_City)}},
\footnote{\link{https://bjconline.org/arkansas-ten-commandments-monument-challenged-as-unconstitutional-052418/}},
\footnote{\link{http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/08/27/ten.commandments/index.html}},
and many others). But the Law is not suitable for these purposes.  A
human court must sometimes find the defendant innocent, but the Law
always enters the same judgment: guilty.

Another enlightening result of this principle is that (ùüö.ùüö) \b{if what
you're hearing isn't condemning you, then it isn't the Law.}  So when
Jesus, as we mentioned before, told the woman caught in the act of
adultery, "Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more" (John 8:11),
He can't have been teaching the Law, as His words weren't condemning
her. Similarly, when the scripture says, "For God did not send His Son
into the world to condemn  the world, but that the world through Him
might be saved" (John 3:17), it tells us that Jesus didn't come to
deliver the Law, because the Law only condemns. (It's almost like
Jesus said, "I didn't come into the world to condemn the world," and
the Law says, "I came into the world to condemn the world!")

\emptypara

The third tool we find in Romans 3:19 is a bit more niche, but no less
powerful than the others. Earlier we learned that the Law speaks only
to those under it. But, we might ask, who is under it? The verse
reads, "whatever the law says, it says ... that \i{every} mouth may be
stopped, and \i{all the world} may become guilty before God"
(emph. added). So our final axiom is that (ùüõ) \b{everyone begins under
the Law.} That is to say, everyone\---{}"all the world"\---{}feels
compunction by the condemnation of the Law, so that no one can claim
ignorance.

This one might seem less revolutionary than our previous
discussions. But (ùüõ) is nicely suited for understanding how we, as
completely sinful human beings, can even comprehend or think valuable
the good and holy things God offers us. Some say that we are incapable
of doing so, that humanity lives by default in a state of "total
depravity," unable to even desire salvation until we are individually
selected by God and receive the desire to believe from Him. But I
think what they miss is that, while we are indeed depraved, we also
have the work of the Law written on our hearts. Romans 2:14-15 says,
"For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the
things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to
themselves: \sup{15}Which show the work of the law written in their
hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the
mean while accusing or else excusing one another." In other words, the
non-Jews, who weren't directly given the Ten Commandments by God like
the Jews, still know right from wrong. They and we, both Jew and non-,
have the requirements of the Law written on the heart, if not on
tablets of stone; and we all demonstrate this by making moral
accusations (usually of others) and excuses (usually for
ourselves). Not everyone has the exact same laws, not everyone's
conscience pricks them for the same things. They differ across
countries, cultures, religions, and even times. But everyone has the
\i{work} of the Law, that essential "Do \i{X} or else, don't do \i{Y}
or else."  The contents don't matter; it's the form that's the
same. We always end up accused, one way or another.

So the Law is actually the bridge between us, who are carnal, and God,
who is spiritual. Despite the facts that "there is none righteous, no,
not one" (Romans 3:10), and that, "in my flesh there dwells no good
thing" (7:18), we still have this piece stuck inside us\---{}"written
on our hearts"\---{}which is itself spiritual: "We know that the law
is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin"
(7:14). This piece acts as the "sensor" that attunes us to the offer
of the Gospel. It's how we feel guilt, and how we even know we need a
savior. And according to (ùüõ), that's built in to everyone, no special
selection from God required. Some people respond to the accusation of
the Law by pointing out all the good they have done on the contrary,
and promising to do more. Others respond by crying out for mercy. But
everyone has this spiritual sense nonetheless. Therefore we can
earnestly proclaim that Jesus died for the whole world, that God's
offer of salvation is to everyone, that anyone who wants to be saved
will be saved, and we can be confident that the Law is attempting to
prepare people's hearts to hear just this message. We just need to
step back and the schoolmaster do its work.

\emptypara

All in all, Romans 3:19 is an essential scripture in anyone's
repertoire. It's nearly unparalleled in information density, and it
sits at a busy intersection between so many of the strange and alien
ideas we find in the scriptures which seem so foreign to our
minds. Although it keeps a low profile, on the scale of usefulness it
ranks in with the likes of "God justifies the ungodly," "I rejoice in
my infirmities," and "Faith works by love," if not "The just shall
live by faith." And I don't pretend that by this discussion I have
even begun to exhaust what this verse has to offer. I am certain that
there is more insight to be had from these few words in Romans, and I
look forward to hearing what others are led to discover!
