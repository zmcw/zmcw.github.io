<h1 class="article-title">The Meanings of Hebrews 12:14-17</h1>


<p>It’s easy to see how <a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12%3A14-17&version=NKJV">Hebrews 12:14-17</a> could be a harrowing read
for someone new in the faith who is encountering the verses for the first time:

</p><div class="scripture-block-quote"><div><sup class="laligned superscript">14</sup>Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the
Lord:</div><div><sup class="laligned superscript">15</sup>looking carefully lest anyone fall short of the grace of God; lest any root of
bitterness springing up cause trouble, and by this many become defiled;</div><div><sup class="laligned superscript">16</sup>lest there be any fornicator or profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of
food sold his birthright.</div><div><sup class="laligned superscript">17</sup>For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was
rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently
with tears.</div><div class="quote-attrib"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12%3A14-17&version=NKJV">Hebrews 12:14-17</a>, NKJV</div></div>

<p>A straghtforward reading might leave us with several questions:

</p><div class="customlist"><div><span class="laligned">1.&nbsp;</span>Try as I might, I am not a holy person, and I sin often; according to verse
14, am I unable now and/or will I be unable later to see God?</div>
<div><span class="laligned">2.&nbsp;</span>Since I do commit sins often, and I haven’t been able to
overcome them yet, have I fallen short of the grace of God, like in verse 15?</div>
<div><span class="laligned">3.&nbsp;</span>I have committed fornication (if not with my body, then I have lusted after
someone in and committed fornication in my heart already as in
<a class="bref" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A28&version=NIV">Matthew 5:28</a>). And not only that, but I fear that I may fall to
that temptation again at some point in the future, despite how much it grieves
me. What does this verse say about me?</div>
<div><span class="laligned">4.&nbsp;</span>If Esau changed his mind and sought forgiveness, why was he rejected?
Doesn’t God forgive people who ask for forgiveness? Is it ever too late to
receive forgiveness?</div>
</div>

<p>These can be very distressing questions and I think it’s important that
Christians are able to lay these worries to rest clearly and convincingly with
arguments from the scripture.
