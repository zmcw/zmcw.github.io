<h1 class="article-title">The Surprising Utility of Romans 3:19</h1>


<p>Word for word, Romans 3:19 is one of the richest veins in the entire
scripture for the purpose of proving doctrinal arguments, and it
states with dispositive authority what other scriptures might leave
open to interpretation. It reads like this:

</p>
<p><div class="scripture-block-quote">
<p>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under
the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become
guilty before God.

</p><p></p><div class="quote-attrib"><a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>, NKJV</div></div>

<p>In just these few short words, Paul makes no fewer than three strong
assertions about the nature of our relationship to God and the
Law. Their clarity, brevity, and unequivocality make them ideal
building blocks for proving larger theories and resolving doctrinal
contentions that arise on these subjects. Each one acts as a tool to
discover deeper truths, and as a guardrail to keep us from erroneous
understanding. It is worth exploring them in detail.

</p>
<p>Paul frames the first tool he gives us as being natural, almost
obvious: “Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who
are under the law...” It’s easy to let this one slip by without fully
grasping the weight of it. The contrapositive is actually so much more
striking that we’ll prefer it over the original formulation, and it is
this: if whatever the Law says is directed at those who are under
it, then (𝟙) <b>the Law does not say anything whatsoever to those who
are not under it.</b> This, combined with the statement “you [believers]
are not under law but under grace” from a few chapters later in Romans
6:14 gives us the corollary (𝟙.𝕒) that <b>the law has nothing
whatsoever to say to Christians.</b>

</p><p>This statement is quite controversial in some circles. Martin Luther,
for example, famously asserted that the Law has three uses: one, as a
“curb,” to prevent people from doing evil, via the pangs of
conscience; two, as a “mirror,” to show us that we are sinners; and
three, as a “guide,” to show Christians how to live [citation
needed]. But this third use of the Law is disproved by (𝟙.𝕒), because
it directly contradicts the notion that the Law does not speak to
Christians. Should we be surprised? Yes!  It’s very natural to think
that the Law should play some continuing role in our lives, because
(and a whole essay could be written on this topic alone) the work of
the Law is written on our hearts (Romans 2:15), so we operate by
default within its frame of reference, and we have to work hard to
shake it off.  But surprising though our theorem is, it wasn’t
completely untelegraphed.

</p>
<p>Let’s remember what the Law actually is (and not): the Law is not a
collection of moral principles like “do not steal,” “do not kill,”
etc; rather, the law is these, bundled together with a consequence
for breaking them.  We know this from Romans 10:5, which says, “Moses
writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: ‘The person
who does these things will live by them.’” In other words, the
righteousness of the Law is fundamentally of the form “do <i>X</i> and
live,” for some command X (and by implication, “fail to do <i>X</i> and
die”).  The Law spells out its punishment for us in Ezekiel 18:20,
“The soul who sins shall die,” echoed in Romans 6:23, “The wages of
sin is death.” And it’s important to keep this precise definition of
Law in mind, because otherwise we end up thinking things like the law
is repeated in the New Testament (it’s not; Ephesians 4:28’s “Let him
who stole steal no more” lacks the Law’s consequent “or die,” and the
same can be said about Christ’s “Go and sin no more” to the woman
caught in the act of adultery, and all the rest, so these by
definition can’t be the Law), or that Jesus kept the Law (He didn’t;
the Law is a shadow of Christ, and how can a man “keep” his shadow?
rather, He <i>fulfilled</i> the Law, being that which the Law was
modeled from, and much more), or some such thing, and the entire
doctrine of the New Testament unravels for trying to fit two—Grace and
Law—inside the sweater meant for one.

</p>
<p>So with the right definition in mind, it should make sense that the
Law has nothing to 
say to Christians, as the very thing that makes the Law a “law” (as opposed
to a suggestion or recommendation, namely, the penalty of death), was
already spent on Christ, and is incapable of reaching us now. And the rest
of the scripture confirms this wonderful—but yes, strange—state of
affairs. For example, Romans 7:4 reads, “Therefore, my brethren, you
also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ...”
Obviously, the law does not speak to the dead—who ever heard of
putting a dead man on trial? Furthermore, how could that which is not
of faith (“and the law is not of faith,” Galatians 3:12) have anything
to add to us, to whom “whatsoever is not of faith is sin” (Romans
14:23)? That’s worth saying again: whatsoever is not of faith is sin,
and the Law—remember, “<i>do</i> thus and so for righteousness”—is not
of faith. This <i>doing</i> of the Law is the very opposite of faith, because the
opposite of faith is fact: “Faith is the evidence of things not seen”
(Hebrews 11:1). So if you can see it (like you can see me <i>do</i> the
law), then it’s not “of faith.”

</p>
<p>Galatians 5:4 says, “Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever
of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from grace,” and the
statement in (𝟙) is a readymade for defying the gravity of the Law. Any
attempts to reintroduce elements of the Law—which attempts are often disguised
to sound well-meaning and reasonable to our Law-based sensibilities, e.g. “Well, if so-and-so were <i>really</i> a Christian, then they wouldn’t
have done that,” or the perennial favorite, “repent and turn from your
sins, sister, and then God will forgive you”—should be met flatly with a
citation of (𝟙).

</p>
<p>The second tool Romans 3:19 equips us with concerns the purpose of the
Law: “whatever the law says, it says ... that every mouth may be
stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.”

</p>
<p> Furthermore,
Paul writes in Galatians 3 that “the law was our schoolmaster to bring
us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that
faith is come, <i>we are no longer under a schoolmaster</i>‍”
(emph. added). 

</p>
<p>It ranks with the likes of “The just shall live by faith,” “the law
entered that the offense might abound,” and “In Christ, neither
circumcision [keeping the law] nor uncircumcision [breaking the law]
availeth any thing, but faith, which worketh by love.”
