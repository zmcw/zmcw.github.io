<h1 class="article-title">The Surprising Utility of Romans 3:19</h1>


<p>Word for word, Romans 3:19 is one of the most densely packed
scriptures in the New Testament. Its understated phraseology belies a
rich seam of axioms which are extremely useful for resolving
contentions that arise on several fundamental points of Christian
doctrine. This single sentence from the apostle Paul’s largest extant
written work states with dispositive authority what others from all
around the New Testament might seem to leave open to
interpretation. It reads like this:

</p><div class="scripture-block-quote"><div>
Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are
under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may
become guilty before God.
</div><div class="quote-attrib"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=NKJV">Romans 3:19</a>, NKJV</div></div>

<p>In just these few short words, Paul makes no fewer than three strong
assertions about the nature of our relationship to God and the
Law. Herein he compactly addresses these questions:

</p><ol><li>To whom does the Law speak?</li>
<li>What does the Law say to them?</li>
<li>Why does the Law say what it says?</li>
</ol>

<p>This one verse answers these with clarity, brevity, and unequivocality
to grant us deep insights into Law, Sin, Grace, and the Gospel. Each
part acts as a tool to discover deeper truths, and as a guardrail to
keep us from erroneous understanding. It is worth exploring them in
detail.

</p>&nbsp;
<p>Paul frames the first part of his statement as being natural, almost
obvious: “Now we know that <i>whatever the law says</i>, it says <i>to
those who are under the law</i>...” And it does sound almost tautological
in a way, so it’s easy to let this one slip by without fully grasping
the weight of it. The contrapositive is actually so much more striking
that we’ll prefer it over the original formulation, and it is this: if
whatever the Law says is directed at those who are under it, then (𝟙)
<b>the Law does not say anything whatsoever to those who are not under
it.</b>  This, combined with the claim that “you [believers] are not
under law but under grace” from a few chapters later in Romans 6:14
gives us the corollary that (𝟙.𝕒) <b>the Law has nothing whatsoever to
say to Christians.</b>

</p><p>This statement would be quite controversial in some circles. For
example, reformed thinkers (and perhaps to a lesser extent, Lutheran
theologians), hold that the Law has three uses: one, as a “curb” to
prevent people from doing evil, via the pangs of conscience (also
called the “civil use”); two, as a “mirror,” to show us that we are
sinners (the “pedagogical use”); and three, as a “guide,” to show
Christians how to live (the “didactic use”) <a id="reference-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. But this third use of the Law is rebutted by
(𝟙.𝕒), because it directly contradicts the notion that the Law does
not speak to Christians. If you’re surprised by this, then you’re in
good company, that’s exactly the reaction Jesus got everywhere he went
<a id="reference-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>. (In fact, the best way to
tell how well you’re understanding each of these is to measure how far
your jaw dropped.)  It’s very natural to think that the Law should
play some continuing role in our lives, because, as we’ll discuss
later, we operate by default within the Law’s frame of reference
(Romans 2:15). We always fall back to the mode of making accusations
and defenses, keeping an account of the works we have done and we have
earned by them, and we have to work hard to break free of that
<a id="reference-3" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>.  But surprising though our
theorem is, it’s not completely unforeshadowed by what information we
already have.

</p><p>Let’s remember what the Law actually is: the Law is not a collection
of moral principles like “do not steal,” “do not kill,” etc. Rather,
the Law is these, bundled together with a consequence for breaking
them.  We know this from Romans 10:5, which says, “Moses writes this
about the righteousness that is by the law: ‘The person who does these
things will live by them.’” In other words, the righteousness of the
Law is fundamentally of the form “do <i>X</i> and live,” for some command
X (and by implication, “fail to do <i>X</i> and die”).  The Law spells
out its punishment in Ezekiel 18:20, “The soul who sins shall die,”
echoed in Romans 6:23, “The wages of sin is death.” This if-then
structure is essential to the nature of any law, not just the
spiritual one. Even the speed limit is not a law just because it says
“Don’t drive over sixty.” It’s a law because it says, “<i>If</i> you
drive over sixty, <i>then</i> you will get a fine.” Without a consequent,
what you have is a suggestion or recommendation or something, but not
a law. And it’s important to keep this precise definition in mind,
because otherwise we end up thinking things like the Law is repeated
in the New Testament <a id="reference-4" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>, or that Jesus kept the Law <a id="reference-5" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>, or some such thing, and the
entire system of doctrine of the New Testament degenerates into
incoherence.

</p><p>So with the right definition in mind, it should make sense that the
Law has nothing to say to Christians, as the very thing that makes the
Law a “law,” namely the penalty of death, was already spent on Christ,
is incapable of being applied to us now.  And the rest of the
scripture confirms this wonderful&#8288;—&#8288;but yes, strange&#8288;—&#8288;state of
affairs. Paul writes, for example, “Therefore, my brethren, you also
have become dead to the law through the body of Christ [...]
<sup class="superscript">6</sup>Now we are released from the law, having died to that which
held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not
in the old way of the written code” (Romans 7:4, 6).  Obviously, the
Law does not speak to the dead; the dead are no longer under the Law’s
<i>juris-diction,</i> which word comes from two Latin components
literally meaning “law-speak.”  Who ever heard of putting a dead man
on trial?  Furthermore, how could that which is not of faith (“and the
law is not of faith,” Galatians 3:12) have anything to add to us, to
whom “whatsoever is not of faith is sin” (Romans 14:23)? That’s worth
saying again: whatsoever is not of faith is sin, and the
Law&#8288;—&#8288;remember, “<i>do</i> thus and so for righteousness”&#8288;—&#8288;is not
of faith. This <i>doing</i> of the Law is the very opposite of faith,
because the opposite of faith is fact: “Faith is the evidence of
things not seen” (Hebrews 11:1). So if you can see it (like you can
see me <i>doing</i> the Law), then it’s not “of faith.”  The
righteousness we have in Christ, on the other hand, is actually
invisible because it’s in the future; for now, I still look like a
sinner to an uninformed observer <a id="reference-6" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>. Yet God calls those things
which are not as though they were (Romans 4:17), and bids me do the
same, right in the middle of my squalor. It is for this reason that I
can say, “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,
but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I
live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself
for me.”  That’s the reason it can even be called “righteousness <i>by
faith.</i>”

</p><p>Galatians 5:4 says, “Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever
of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from grace,” and the
statement in (𝟙) is a readymade for defying the gravity of the
Law. Any attempts to reintroduce elements of the Law&#8288;—&#8288;which attempts
are often disguised to sound well-meaning and reasonable to our
Law-based sensibilities, e.g. “Well, if so-and-so were <i>really</i> a
Christian, then they wouldn’t have done that,” or the perennial
favorite, “repent and turn from your sins, sister, and God will
forgive you”&#8288;—&#8288;should be countered flatly with a recitation of (𝟙).

</p>&nbsp;
<p>The second tool Romans 3:19 equips us with concerns the purpose of the
Law: “whatever the law says, it says ... that every mouth may be
<i>stopped</i>, and all the world may become <i>guilty</i> before God.” We
already learned that the Law only speaks to those under the Law, not
to Christians. But this part informs us that, even when it’s speaking
to non-Christians, (𝟚) <b>the Law says what it says it to condemn you
before God.</b> In other words, the Law’s purpose is to bring its
audience to muted guilt for their sins against it. But, critically,
Paul uses the words “<i>whatever</i> the law says.” So, condemnation is
not just <i>one</i> of several purposes of the Law, it is the Law’s
<i>one and only purpose.</i> This leads us to state that (𝟚.𝕒) <b>the Law
has no other purpose than to condemn you.</b> It never speaks to you to
tell you that you are correct or righteous, because you are never
correct or righteous; nor does it speak to you to convince you to
change, because you can never change. It hears no excuses, it brooks
no defenses, it gives no second chances, it accepts only guilty
silence.

</p><p>This second axiom contradicts the designation of the Law as a “curb”
to restrain the evil in the world. But as if that weren’t enough, it
turns out that the whole purpose of the Law from the very beginning
was actually to make sin abound! “Now the law entered in, that sin
might abound...” (Romans 5:20, first part). Far from being a bane to
evil, the Law is actually the strength of sin! “The sting of death is
sin, and the strength of sin is the law” (1 Corinthians 15:56). Paul
describes the dire state of affairs in Romans 7:

</p><div class="scripture-block-quote"><div><sup class="laligned superscript">7</sup>What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it
had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not
have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall not
covet.”</div><div><sup class="laligned superscript">8</sup>But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in
me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead.</div><div><sup class="laligned superscript">9</sup>I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment
came, sin came alive and I died.</div><div><sup class="laligned superscript">10</sup>The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.</div><div><sup class="laligned superscript">11</sup>For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me
and through it killed me.</div><div class="quote-attrib"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A7-11&version=ESV">Romans 7:7-11</a>, ESV</div></div>

<p>The Law is not your friend: “for the law works wrath” (Romans
4:15). Someone might say that the Law doesn’t actually create the sin,
it just shows you what’s already there. And that’s where I agree with
the Lutheran analysis. The Law does make a superb mirror to show you
how wretched you are: “for by the Law is the knowledge of sin” (Romans
3:20). The mirror doesn’t create the dirt you see on your face, of
course. But this doesn’t change the fact that the Law’s sole and
simple purpose is to indict and convict you for the capital offense of
being a sinner. Any restraint from evil this produces in you is an
accident, and insofar as it fosters any sense of accomplishment or
righteousness, it is actually contrary to the Law’s stated purpose: to
crush all hope of keeping it, so that you perceive the reality of your
situation, and, possibly, start searching for righteousness outside of
yourself; to finally wring out of you, after all your best attempts
have failed, one last cry, one last desperate gasp for air: “O
wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
death?” (Romans 7:24). Dante wrote that above the gates of Hell the
words are inscribed, <span class="smallcaps">All hope abandon, ye who enter here.</span> But these
words are perhaps just as appropriate for the entrance to the temple
of the Law.

</p><p>But in a strange and wonderful twist, God transformed what would have
been our sure damnation into an integral part of the mechanism for our
salvation: “...where sin abounded, grace did more abound” (Romans
5:20, second part)! So the sequence is this: where the Law is strong,
sin abounds. But where sin abounds, grace superabounds. And where
grace superabounds, love abounds; for who is forgiven much loves much
(Luke 7:47). This journey from Sin to Law to Grace to Love is the road
that every Christian takes to Christ. Look at Paul: Pharisee of
Pharisees, of the tribe of Benjamin, circumcised the eighth day,
zealous persecutor of the Church, defender of the Law. But the harder
he worked to keep the Law, the more material Sin had to use against
him. This ended up compelling him to seek Grace, and he found it in
Christ. For this critical role it plays in our salvation, Paul gave
the Law a new name in Galatians 3:24-25: “the law was our schoolmaster
to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.” Then he
adds, “But after that faith is come, <i>we are no longer under a
schoolmaster”</i> (emph. added). When it comes to the Law, our only hope
is to die, so that we can be raised with Christ.

</p><p>(𝟚) is useful any time people try to use the Law for the wrong
thing. For example, some people think that the Ten Commandments should
be used as a political device, to guide lawmakers or to stand watch
over our courthouses and state capitol buildings (see
<a id="reference-7" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>,
<a id="reference-8" href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>,
<a id="reference-9" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>,
and many others). But the Law is not suitable for these purposes.  A
human court must sometimes find the defendant innocent, but the Law
always enters the same judgment: guilty.

</p><p>Another enlightening result, supplied by the application of <i>modus
tollens</i> to (𝟚), is that (𝟚.𝕓) <b>if what you’re hearing isn’t
condemning you, then it isn’t the Law.</b>  So when Jesus told the woman
caught in the act of adultery, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin
no more” (John 8:11), He can’t have been teaching the Law, as His
words weren’t condemning her. Similarly, when the scripture says, “For
God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that
the world through Him might be saved” (John 3:17), it tells us that
Jesus didn’t come to deliver the Law, because the Law only
condemns. (It’s almost like Jesus said, “I didn’t come into the world
to condemn the world,” and the Law says, “I came into the world to
condemn the world!”)

</p>&nbsp;
<p>The third tool we find in Romans 3:19 is a bit more niche, but no less
powerful than the others. Principle (𝟙) states that the Law speaks
only to those under it. But, we might ask, who is under it? The verse
reads, “whatever the law says, it says ... that <i>every</i> mouth may be
stopped, and <i>all the world</i> may become guilty before God.” Since
Paul uses the words “all the world,” we can infer that (𝟛) <b>everyone
begins under the Law.</b> That is to say, everyone feels compunction by
the condemnation of the Law, so that no one can claim ignorance.

</p><p>This one might seem less revolutionary than our previous
discussions. But (𝟛) is nicely suited for understanding how we, as
completely sinful human beings, can even comprehend or think valuable
the good and holy things God offers us. Some say that we are incapable
of doing so, that humanity lives by default in a state of “total
depravity,” unable to even desire salvation until we are individually
selected by God and receive the desire to believe from Him. But I
think what they miss is that, while we are indeed depraved, we also
have the work of the Law written on our hearts. Romans 2:14-15 says,
“For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the
things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to
themselves: <sup class="superscript">15</sup>Which show the work of the law written in their
hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the
mean while accusing or else excusing one another.” In other words,
even unsaved non-Jews, who weren’t directly given the Ten Commandments
by God like the Jews, still know right from wrong. They and we, both
Jew and non-, have the requirements of the Law written on the heart,
if not on tablets of stone; and we all demonstrate this by making
moral accusations (usually of others) and excuses (usually for
ourselves). Not everyone has the exact same laws, not everyone’s
conscience pricks them for the same things. They differ across
countries, cultures, religions, and even times. But everyone has the
<i>work</i> of the Law, that essential “Do <i>X</i> or else, don’t do <i>Y</i>
or else.”  The contents don’t matter; it’s the form that’s the
same. We always end up accused, one way or another.

</p><p>So the Law is actually the bridge between us, who are carnal, and God,
who is spiritual. Despite the facts that “there is none righteous, no,
not one” (Romans 3:10), and that, “in my flesh there dwells no good
thing” (7:18), we still have this piece stuck inside us&#8288;—&#8288;“written
on our hearts”&#8288;—&#8288;which is itself spiritual: “We know that the law
is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin”
(7:14). This piece acts as the “sensor” that attunes us to the offer
of the Gospel. It’s how we feel guilt, and how we even know we need a
savior. And according to (𝟛), that’s built in to everyone, no special
selection from God required. Some people respond to the accusation of
the Law by pointing out all the good they have done on the contrary,
and promising to do more. Others respond by crying out for mercy. But
everyone has this spiritual sense nonetheless. Therefore we can
earnestly proclaim that Jesus died for the whole world, that God’s
offer of salvation is to everyone, that anyone who wants to be saved
will be saved, and we can be confident that the Law is attempting to
prepare people’s hearts to hear just this message. We just need to
step back and the schoolmaster do its work <a id="reference-10" href="#footnote-10">[10]</a>.

</p>&nbsp;
<p>In conclusion, here are the statements we’ve gleaned from Romans 3:19:

</p><div class="customlist"><div><span class="laligned">𝟙)</span>&nbsp;The Law does not say anything whatsoever to those who are not
under it.</div>
<div><span class="laligned">𝟙.𝕒)</span>&nbsp;The Law has nothing whatsoever to say to Christians.</div>
<div><span class="laligned">𝟚)</span>&nbsp;The Law says what it says it to condemn you before God.</div>
<div><span class="laligned">𝟚.𝕒)</span>&nbsp;The Law has no other purpose than to condemn you.</div>
<div><span class="laligned">𝟚.𝕓)</span>&nbsp;If what you’re hearing isn’t condemning you, then it isn’t the
Law.</div>
<div><span class="laligned">𝟛)</span>&nbsp;Everyone begins under the Law.</div>
</div>

<p>As I’ve hoped to show, the verse is an essential scripture in anyone’s
repertoire. It’s nearly unparalleled in information density, and it
sits at a busy intersection between so many of the strange and alien
ideas we find in the scriptures which seem so foreign to our
minds. Although it keeps a low profile, on the scale of usefulness it
ranks in with the likes of “God justifies the ungodly,” “I rejoice in
my infirmities,” and “Faith works by love,” if not “The just shall
live by faith.” And I don’t pretend that by this discussion I have
even begun to exhaust what this verse has to offer. I am certain that
there is more insight to be had from these few words in Romans, and I
look forward to hearing what others are led to discover!
