<h1 class="article-title">The Surprising Utility of Romans 3:19</h1>


<p>Word for word, Romans 3:19 is one of the richest veins in the entire
scripture for the purpose of proving doctrinal arguments, and it
states with dispositive authority what other scriptures might leave
open to interpretation. It reads like this:

</p>
<p><div class="scripture-block-quote">
<p>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under
the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become
guilty before God.

</p><p></p><div class="quote-attrib"><a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>, NKJV</div></div>

<p>In just these few short words, Paul makes no fewer than three strong
assertions about the nature of our relationship to God and the
Law. Their clarity, brevity, and unequivocality make them ideal
building blocks for proving larger theories and resolving doctrinal
contentions that arise on these subjects. Each one acts as a tool to
discover deeper truths, and as a guardrail to keep us from erroneous
understanding. It is worth exploring them in detail.

</p>
<p>Paul frames the first tool he gives us as being natural, almost
obvious: “Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who
are under the law...” It’s easy to let this one slip by without fully
grasping the weight of it. The contrapositive is actually so much more
striking that we’ll prefer it over the original formulation, and it is
this: if whatever the Law says is directed at those who are under
it, then (𝟙) <b>the Law does not say anything whatsoever to those who
are not under it.</b> This, combined with the statement “you [believers]
are not under law but under grace” from a few chapters later in Romans
6:14 gives us the corollary (𝟙.𝕒) that <b>the law has nothing
whatsoever to say to Christians.</b>

</p><p>This statement is quite controversial in some circles. Martin Luther,
for example, famously asserted that the Law has three uses: one, as a
“curb,” to prevent people from doing evil, via the pangs of
conscience; two, as a “mirror,” to show us that we are sinners; and
three, as a “guide,” to show Christians how to live [citation
needed]. But this third use of the Law is disproved by (𝟙.𝕒), because
it directly contradicts the notion that the Law does not speak to
Christians. Should we be surprised? Yes!  It’s very natural to think
that the Law should play some continuing role in our lives, because
(and a whole essay could be written on this topic alone) the work of
the Law is written on our hearts (Romans 2:15), so we operate by
default within its frame of reference, and we have to work hard to
shake it off.  But surprising though our theorem is, it wasn’t
completely untelegraphed.

</p>
<p>Let’s remember what the Law actually is (and not): the Law is not a
collection of moral principles like “do not steal,” “do not kill,”
etc. Rather, the law is these, bundled together with a consequence
for breaking them.  We know this from Romans 10:5, which says, “Moses
writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: ‘The person
who does these things will live by them.’” In other words, the
righteousness of the Law is fundamentally of the form “do <i>X</i> and
live,” for some command X (and by implication, “fail to do <i>X</i> and
die”).  The Law spells out its punishment for us in Ezekiel 18:20,
“The soul who sins shall die,” echoed in Romans 6:23, “The wages of
sin is death.” And it’s important to keep this precise definition of
Law in mind, because otherwise we end up thinking things like the law
is repeated in the New Testament (it’s not; Ephesians 4:28’s “Let him
who stole steal no more” lacks the Law’s consequent “or die,” and the
same can be said about Christ’s “Go and sin no more” to the woman
caught in the act of adultery, and all the rest, so these by
definition can’t be the Law), or that Jesus kept the Law (He didn’t;
the Law is a shadow of Christ, and how can a man “keep” his shadow?
rather, He <i>fulfilled</i> the Law, being that which the Law was
modeled from, and much more), or some such thing, and the entire
doctrine of the New Testament unravels for trying to fit two—Grace and
Law—inside the sweater meant for one.

</p>
<p>So with the right definition in mind, it should make sense that the
Law has nothing to 
say to Christians, as the very thing that makes the Law a “law” (as opposed
to a suggestion or recommendation, namely, the penalty of death), was
already spent on Christ, and is incapable of reaching us now. And the rest
of the scripture confirms this wonderful—but yes, strange—state of
affairs. For example, Romans 7:4 reads, “Therefore, my brethren, you
also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ...”
Obviously, the law does not speak to the dead—who ever heard of
putting a dead man on trial? Furthermore, how could that which is not
of faith (“and the law is not of faith,” Galatians 3:12) have anything
to add to us, to whom “whatsoever is not of faith is sin” (Romans
14:23)? That’s worth saying again: whatsoever is not of faith is sin,
and the Law—remember, “<i>do</i> thus and so for righteousness”—is not
of faith. This <i>doing</i> of the Law is the very opposite of faith, because the
opposite of faith is fact: “Faith is the evidence of things not seen”
(Hebrews 11:1). So if you can see it (like you can see me <i>doing</i> the
law), then it’s not “of faith.” The righteousness we have in
Christ, on the other hand, is actually invisible; I still look like a sinner to an
uninformed observer (c.f. 1 John 2:1, “My little children, I am
writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone
does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
righteous...”). That’s the reason it can even be called “righteousness <i>by faith.</i>‍”

</p>
<p>Galatians 5:4 says, “Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever
of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from grace,” and the
statement in (𝟙) is a readymade for defying the gravity of the Law. Any
attempts to reintroduce elements of the Law—which attempts are often disguised
to sound well-meaning and reasonable to our Law-based sensibilities, e.g. “Well, if so-and-so were <i>really</i> a Christian, then they wouldn’t
have done that,” or the perennial favorite, “repent and turn from your
sins, sister, and God will forgive you”—should be countered flatly with a
recitation of (𝟙).

</p>
<p>The second tool Romans 3:19 equips us with concerns the purpose of the
Law: “whatever the law says, it says ... that every mouth may be
stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.” We knew that
the Law only speaks to those under the Law, not Christians. But this
informs us that, even when it’s speaking to non-Christians, (𝟚)
<b>whatever the Law says, it says it to condemn you before God.</b> In
other words, the Law has no other purpose than to bring 
its listeners to muted guilt for their
sins against it—no excuses, no defenses, just guilty silence. 

</p>
<p>This second axiom contradicts Martin Luther’s designation of the Law as a
“curb” to restrain the evil in the world. But as if that weren’t
enough, it turns out that the whole purpose of the Law from the very
beginning was actually to <i>make sin abound!</i> “Now the law entered
in, that sin might abound...”—but God —“...where sin abounded,
grace did more abound” (ibid)!

</p>
<p>The principle itself is
useful for when people try to use the Law for the wrong thing. For
example, . 

</p>
<p>Another enlightening result of this principle is: (𝟚.𝟙) <b>if what
you're hearing isn't condemning you, then it isn't the Law.</b> So when
Jesus, as we mentioned before, told the woman caught in the act of
adultery, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more” (John 8:11),
He can’t have been delivering the Law, as His words weren’t condemning
her. Similarly, when the scripture says, “For God did not send His Son
into the world to condemn  the world, but that the world through Him
might be saved” (John 3:17), it tells us that Jesus didn’t come to
deliver the Law, because the Law only condemns. (It’s almost like
Jesus said, “I didn’t come into the world to condemn the world,” and
the Law says, “I came into the world to condemn the world!”)

</p>
<p> Furthermore,
Paul writes in Galatians 3 that “the law was our schoolmaster to bring
us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that
faith is come, <i>we are no longer under a schoolmaster</i>‍”
(emph. added). 

</p>
<p>Who does the law apply to? Everyone.

</p>
<p>It ranks with the likes of “The just shall live by faith,” “the law
entered that the offense might abound,” and “In Christ, neither
circumcision [keeping the law] nor uncircumcision [breaking the law]
availeth any thing, but faith, which worketh by love.”
