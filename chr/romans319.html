<h1 class="article-title">The Surprising Utility of Romans 3:19</h1>


<p>Word for word, Romans 3:19 is one of the richest veins in the entire
scripture for the purpose of proving doctrinal arguments, and it
states with dispositive authority what other scriptures might leave
open to interpretation. It reads like this:

</p><div class="scripture-block-quote">
Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are
under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may
become guilty before God.
<div class="quote-attrib"><a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>, NKJV</div></div>

<p>In just these few short words, Paul makes no fewer than three strong
assertions about the nature of our relationship to God and the
Law. This one verse compactly addresses these questions:

</p><ol><li>To whom does the Law speak?</li>
<li>What does the Law say to them?</li>
<li>Why does the Law say what it says?</li>
</ol>

<p>The answers grant us deep insights into Law, Sin, Grace, and the
Gospel, and their clarity, brevity, and unequivocality make them ideal
building blocks for proving larger theories and resolving doctrinal
contentions that arise on these subjects. Each one acts as a tool to
discover deeper truths, and as a guardrail to keep us from erroneous
understanding. It is worth exploring them in detail.

</p><p>Paul frames the first tool he gives us as being natural, almost
obvious: “Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who
are under the law...” And it does sound almost tautological in a way,
so it’s easy to let this one slip by without fully grasping the weight
of it. The contrapositive is actually so much more striking that we’ll
prefer it over the original formulation, and it is this: if whatever
the Law says is directed at those who are under it, then (𝟙) <b>the
Law does not say anything whatsoever to those who are not under it.</b>
This, combined with the claim that “you [believers] are not under law
but under grace” from a few chapters later in Romans 6:14 gives us the
corollary (𝟙.𝕒) that <b>the law has nothing whatsoever to say to
Christians.</b>

</p><p>This statement would be quite controversial in some circles, if anyone
dared to make it. Martin Luther, for example, famously asserted that
the Law has three uses: one, as a “curb,” to prevent people from doing
evil, via the pangs of conscience; two, as a “mirror,” to show us that
we are sinners; and three, as a “guide,” to show Christians how to
live [citation needed]. But this third use of the Law is disproved by
(𝟙.𝕒), because it directly contradicts the notion that the Law does
not speak to Christians. Should we be surprised? Yes!  It’s very
natural to think that the Law should play some continuing role in our
lives, because (and a whole essay could be written on this topic
alone) the work of the Law is written on our hearts (Romans 2:15).  We
operate by default within its frame of reference&#8288;—&#8288;i.e. in the mode
of making accusations, usually of others, and defenses, usually of
ourselves or our friends&#8288;—&#8288;and we have to work hard to break free
of that.  But surprising though our theorem is, it’s not completely
unforeshadowed by what information we already have.

</p><p>Let’s remember what the Law actually is: the Law is not a collection
of moral principles like “do not steal,” “do not kill,” etc. Rather,
the Law is these, bundled together with a consequence for breaking
them.  We know this from Romans 10:5, which says, “Moses writes this
about the righteousness that is by the law: ‘The person who does these
things will live by them.’” In other words, the righteousness of the
Law is fundamentally of the form “do <i>X</i> and live,” for some command
X (and by implication, “fail to do <i>X</i> and die”).  The Law spells
out its punishment in Ezekiel 18:20, “The soul who sins shall die,”
echoed in Romans 6:23, “The wages of sin is death.” This if-then
structure is essential to the nature of any law; without it, what you
have is a suggestion or recommendation or something, but not a
law. And it’s important to keep this precise definition in mind,
because otherwise we end up thinking things like the Law is repeated
in the New Testament (it’s not; Ephesians 4:28’s “Let him who stole
steal no more” lacks the Law’s consequent “or die,” and the same can
be said about Christ’s “Go and sin no more” to the woman caught in the
act of adultery, and all the rest, so these by definition can’t be the
Law), or that Jesus kept the Law (He didn’t; the Law is a shadow of
Christ, and how can a man “keep” his shadow?  rather, He <i>fulfilled</i>
the Law, being that which the Law was modeled from, and much more), or
some such thing, and the entire doctrine of the New Testament unravels
for trying to fit two&#8288;—&#8288;Grace and Law&#8288;—&#8288;inside the sweater meant
for one.

</p><p>So with the right definition in mind, it should make sense that the
Law has nothing to say to Christians, as the very thing that makes the
Law a “law,” namely the penalty of death, was already spent on Christ,
is incapable of reaching us now.  And the rest of the scripture
confirms this wonderful&#8288;—&#8288;but yes, strange&#8288;—&#8288;state of
affairs. For example, Paul writes, “Therefore, my brethren, you also
have become dead to the law through the body of Christ [...]
<span class="superscript">6</span>Now we are released from the law, having died to that which
held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not
in the old way of the written code” (Romans 7:4, 6).  Obviously, the
Law does not speak to the dead; the dead are no longer under the Law’s
<i>juris-diction,</i> which word comes from two Latin components
literally meaning “law-speak.”  Who ever heard of putting a dead man
on trial?  Furthermore, how could that which is not of faith (“and the
law is not of faith,” Galatians 3:12) have anything to add to us, to
whom “whatsoever is not of faith is sin” (Romans 14:23)? That’s worth
saying again: whatsoever is not of faith is sin, and the
Law&#8288;—&#8288;remember, “<i>do</i> thus and so for righteousness”&#8288;—&#8288;is not
of faith. This <i>doing</i> of the Law is the very opposite of faith,
because the opposite of faith is fact: “Faith is the evidence of
things not seen” (Hebrews 11:1). So if you can see it (like you can
see me <i>doing</i> the law), then it’s not “of faith.”  The
righteousness we have in Christ, on the other hand, is actually
invisible because it’s in the future; for now, I still look like a
sinner to an uninformed observer (c.f. the comforting words in 1 John
2:1, “My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you
may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the
Father, Jesus Christ the righteous...”). Yet God calls those things
which are not as though they were (Romans 4:17), and bids me do the
same, right in the middle of my squalor. That’s the reason it can even
be called “righteousness <i>by faith.</i>”

</p><p>Galatians 5:4 says, “Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever
of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from grace,” and the
statement in (𝟙) is a readymade for defying the gravity of the
Law. Any attempts to reintroduce elements of the Law&#8288;—&#8288;which attempts
are often disguised to sound well-meaning and reasonable to our
Law-based sensibilities, e.g. “Well, if so-and-so were <i>really</i> a
Christian, then they wouldn’t have done that,” or the perennial
favorite, “repent and turn from your sins, sister, and God will
forgive you”&#8288;—&#8288;should be countered flatly with a recitation of (𝟙).

</p><p>The second tool Romans 3:19 equips us with concerns the purpose of the
Law: “whatever the law says, it says ... that every mouth may be
stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.” We knew that
the Law only speaks to those under the Law, not to Christians. But this
part informs us that, even when it’s speaking to non-Christians, (𝟚)
<b>whatever the Law says, it says it to condemn you before God.</b>  In
other words, the Law has no other purpose than to bring its audience
 to muted guilt for their sins against
it&#8288;—&#8288;no excuses, no defenses, just guilty silence.

</p><p>This second axiom contradicts Martin Luther’s designation of the Law
as a “curb” to restrain the evil in the world. But as if that weren’t
enough, it turns out that the whole purpose of the Law from the very
beginning was actually to make sin abound! “Now the law entered in,
that sin might abound...” (first part of Romans 5:20). Far from being
a bane to evil, the Law is actually the strength of sin! “The sting of
death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law” (1 Corinthians
15:56). Paul describes the dire state of affairs in Romans 7:

</p><div class="scripture-block-quote"><div><span class="aligned-superscript">7</span>What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it
had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not
have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall not
covet.”</div><div><span class="aligned-superscript">8</span>But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in
me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead.</div><div><span class="aligned-superscript">9</span>I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment
came, sin came alive and I died.</div><div><span class="aligned-superscript">10</span>The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.</div><div><span class="aligned-superscript">11</span>For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me
and through it killed me.</div><div class="quote-attrib">Romans 7:7-11, ESV</div></div>

<p>The Law is not your friend: “for the law works wrath” (Romans
4:15). But this was the plan from the beginning, and in a strange and
wonderful twist, God transformed what would have been our sure
damnation into an integral part of the mechanism for our salvation:
“...where sin abounded, grace did more abound” (second part of Romans
5:20). Someone might say that the Law doesn’t actually create the sin,
it just shows you what’s already there. And that’s where Martin Luther
and I agree. The Law does make a superb mirror to show you how
wretched you are: “for by the Law is the knowledge of sin” (Romans
3:20). The mirror doesn’t create the dirt you see on your face, of
course. But this doesn’t change the fact that the Law’s sole and
simple purpose is to indict and convict you of the capital offense of
being a sinner. Any restraint from evil this produces in you is an
accident, and insofar as it fosters any sense of accomplishment or
righteousness, it is actually contrary to the Law’s stated purpose: to
crush all hope of keeping it, so that you can see the reality of your
situation, and, possibly, start searching for righteousness outside of
yourself; to finally wring out of you, after all your best attempts
have failed, one last cry, one last desperate gasp for air: “O
wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
death?” (Romans 7:24). Dante wrote that above the gates of Hell the
words are inscribed, “All hope abandon, ye who enter here.” But these
words are perhaps just as appropriate for the entrance to the temple
of the Law.

</p><p>So the sequence is this: where the Law is strong, sin abounds. But
where sin abounds, grace superabounds. And where grace superabounds,
love abounds; for who is forgiven much loves much (Luke 7:47). This
journey from Sin to Law to Grace to Love is the road that everyone
Christian takes to Christ. Look at Paul: Pharisee of Pharisees, of the
tribe of Benjamin, circumcised the eighth day, zealous persecutor of
the Church, defender of the Law. But the harder he worked to keep the
Law, the more material Sin had to use against him. This ended up
compelling him to seek Grace, and he found it in Christ. For the
critical role it plays in our salvation, namely, driving us to look
for grace, Paul gave the Law a new name in Galatians 3:24-25: “the
law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be
justified by faith.” Then he adds, “But after that faith is come,
<i>we are no longer under a schoolmaster”</i> (emph. added). When it
comes to the Law, our only hope is to die, so that we can be raised in
Christ.

</p>

<p>The principle itself is
useful for when people try to use the Law for the wrong thing. For
example, . 

</p><p>Another enlightening result of this principle is: (𝟚.𝟙) <b>if what
you’re hearing isn’t condemning you, then it isn’t the Law.</b>  So when
Jesus, as we mentioned before, told the woman caught in the act of
adultery, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more” (John 8:11),
He can’t have been delivering the Law, as His words weren’t condemning
her. Similarly, when the scripture says, “For God did not send His Son
into the world to condemn  the world, but that the world through Him
might be saved” (John 3:17), it tells us that Jesus didn’t come to
deliver the Law, because the Law only condemns. (It’s almost like
Jesus said, “I didn’t come into the world to condemn the world,” and
the Law says, “I came into the world to condemn the world!”)

</p><p>Who does the law apply to? Everyone.

</p><p>It ranks with the likes of “The just shall live by faith,” “the law
entered that the offense might abound,” and “In Christ, neither
circumcision [keeping the law] nor uncircumcision [breaking the law]
availeth any thing, but faith, which worketh by love.”
