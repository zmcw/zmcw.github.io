<h1>The Surprising Utility of Romans 3:19</h1>


<p>Pound for pound, Romans 3:19 is one of the richest veins in the entire
scripture for the purpose of proving doctrinal arguments, and it
states with dispositive authority what other scriptures might leave
open to interpretation. It reads like this:

</p>
<p><div class="scripture-block-quote">
<p>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under
the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become
guilty before God.

</p><p></p><div class="quote-attrib"><a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>, NKJV</div></div>

<p>In just these few short words, Paul makes no fewer than three strong
assertions about the nature of our relationship to God and the
Law. Their clarity, brevity, and unequivocality make them ideal
building blocks for proving larger theories and resolving doctrinal
contentions that arise on these subjects. Each one acts as a tool to
discover deeper truths, and as a guardrail to keep us from erroneous
understanding. It is worth exploring them in detail.

</p>
<p>Paul frames the first tool he gives us as being natural, almost
obvious: “Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who
are under the law...” It’s easy to let this one slip by without fully
grasping the weight of it. The contrapositive is actually so much more
striking that we’ll prefer it over the original formulation, and it is
this: if everything the Law says is directed at those who are under
it, then (𝟙) <b>the Law does not say anything whatsoever to those who
are not under it.</b> This, combined with the statement “you [believers]
are not under law but under grace” from a few chapters later in Romans
6:14 gives us the corollary (𝟙.𝕒) that <b>the law has nothing
whatsoever to say to Christians.</b>

</p><p>This statement is quite controversial in some circles. Martin Luther,
for example, famously asserted that the Law has three uses: one, as a
“curb,” to prevent people from doing evil; two, as a “mirror,” to show
us that we are sinners; and three, as a “guide,” to show Christians
how to live [citation needed]. But this third use of the Law is
disproved by (𝟙.𝕒), because it directly contradicts the notion that
the Law does not speak to Christians. Should we be surprised? Yes! But
it’s not completely untelegraphed.

</p><p>Let us remember what the Law actually is (not): the Law is not a
collection of moral principles like “do not steal”, “do not kill,”
etc; rather, the law is these, <i>bundled together with a consequence
for breaking them.</i> We know this from Romans 10:5, which says, “Moses
writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: ‘The person
who does these things will live by them.’” In other words, the
righteousness of the Law is fundamentally of the form “do <i>X</i> and
live, for some command <i>X</i>‍” (and by implication, “fail to do <i>X</i>
and die”).  The Law spells out its punishment for us in Ezekiel 18:20,
“The soul who sins shall die,” echoed in Romans 6:23, “The wages of
sin is death.” It is important to maintain this strict definition of
Law, otherwise we end up thinking things like the law is repeated in
the New Testament (it’s not; Ephesians 4:28’s “Let him who stole steal
no more” lacks the Law’s consequent “or die,” and the same can be said about
Christ’s “Go and sin no more” to the woman caught in the act of
adultery and all the rest, so these by definition can’t be the Law),
or that Jesus kept the Law (He didn’t; the Law is a shadow of Christ,
and how can a man “keep” his shadow? rather, He <i>fulfilled</i> the
Law, being that which the Law was modeled from, and much more), or
some such thing, and the entire doctrine of the New Testament unravels
for trying to fit two—Grace and Law—inside a sweater meant for one. 

</p>
<p>So that the Law has nothing to say to the Christian should make sense
to anyone familiar with Romans 7:4, which reads, “So, my brothers and
sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ...”
Naturally, the law does not speak to the dead, among whom we number by
faith. Furthermore, how could that which is not of faith (”and the law
is not of faith,” Galatians 3:12) have anything to add to us, to whom “whatsoever
is not of faith is sin” (Romans 14:23)?

</p>
<p>The statement in (𝟙) is perfect for resisting the attempts by certain
teachers to bring us back under the law. Any attempt to s

</p>
<p>The second tool Romans 3:19 equips us with concerns the purpose of the
Law: “whatever the law says, it says ... that every mouth may be
stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.”

</p>
<p> Furthermore,
Paul writes in Galatians 3 that “the law was our schoolmaster to bring
us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that
faith is come, <i>we are no longer under a schoolmaster</i>‍”
(emph. added). 

</p>
<p>It ranks with the likes of “The just shall live by faith,” “the law
entered that the offense might abound,” and “In Christ, neither
circumcision [keeping the law] nor uncircumcision [breaking the law]
availeth any thing, but faith, which worketh by love.”
