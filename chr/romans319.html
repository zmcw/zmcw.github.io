<h1 class="article-title">The Surprising Usefulness of Romans 3:19</h1>


<p>Word for word, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=NKJV">Romans 3:19</a> is one of the most densely
packed scriptures in the New Testament. Its understated phraseology
belies a rich seam of axioms which are not only generally informative,
but also specifically useful for resolving certain contentions that
commonly arise on several fundamental points of Christian
doctrine. This single sentence from the apostle Paul’s largest extant
written work states with dispositive authority what others from all
around the New Testament might seem to leave open to
interpretation. It reads like this:

</p><div class="scripture-block-quote"><div>
Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are
under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may
become guilty before God.
</div><div class="quote-attrib"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=NKJV">Romans 3:19</a>, NKJV</div></div>

<p>In these few short words, Paul makes no fewer than three strong
assertions about the nature of our relationship to God and the Law. He
addresses these questions, among others:

</p><ol><li>To whom does the Law speak?</li>
<li>What does the Law say to them?</li>
<li>Why does the Law say what it says?</li>
</ol>

<p>The verse answers with clarity, brevity, and unequivocality, and
grants us deep insights into many of the major themes in Christian
theology including Law, sin, grace, and the gospel. Each part provides
not just a truth in itself but a tool to discover deeper truths, and
also functions as a guardrail to keep us from erroneous
understanding. As such, it is worth exploring them in greater detail.

</p>&nbsp;
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=NKJV"><p>Romans 3:19</a> can be viewed as a tri-partite logical
assertion, and Paul frames the first part as being natural, almost
obvious: “Now we know that <i>whatever the law says</i>, it says <i>to
those who are under the law</i>...” And it does sound almost tautological
in a way, so it’s easy to let this one slip by without fully grasping
the weight of it. The contrapositive is actually so much more striking
that we’ll prefer it over the original formulation, and it is this: if
whatever the Law says is directed at those who are under it, then (𝟙)
<b>the Law does not say anything whatsoever to those who are not under
it.</b>  This, combined with the claim that “you [believers] are not
under law but under grace” from a few chapters later in
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A14&version=NIV">6:14</a> gives us the corollary that (𝟙.𝕒) <b>the Law
has nothing whatsoever to say to Christians.</b>

</p><p>Despite sounding innocuous, these two statements would be quite
controversial in some circles. For example, many “Reformed” or
Calvinist theologians (and to a perhaps-lesser extent, Lutheran ones)
hold that the Law has three uses: one, as a “curb” to prevent people
from doing evil, via the pangs of conscience (also called the “civil
use”); two, as a “mirror,” to show us that we are sinners (the
“pedagogical use”); and three, as a “guide,” to show Christians how to
live (the “didactic use”) <a id="reference-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. But this third use of the Law requires that
the Law speak to Christians, which is forbidden by (𝟙.𝕒). And in so
many words, the three-uses theory is invalidated.

</p><p>If you’re surprised by this, then you’re in good company, because
that’s exactly the reaction Jesus got everywhere he went
<a id="reference-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>. (In
fact, the best way to tell how well we’re understanding each of these
is to measure how far our jaw drops.)  It’s very natural to think that
the Law should play some continuing role in our lives, because, as
we’ll discuss later, we operate by default within the Law’s frame of
reference (<a target="_blank" href="https://studybible.info/AKJV/Romans 2:14-15">Romans 2:14-15</a>). We always fall back to the
mode of making accusations and defenses, keeping an account of the
works we have done and what we have earned by them, and we have to
struggle to break away from that mindset to move towards grace
<a id="reference-3" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>. But though our theorem
is surprising, it’s not completely unforeshadowed by what information
we already have.

</p><p>Let’s remember what the Law actually is. The Law is not a collection
of moral principles like “do not steal,” “do not kill,” etc. Rather,
the Law is these, bundled together with a consequence for breaking
them.  We know this from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A5&version=NIV">Romans 10:5</a>, which says, “Moses
writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: ‘The person
who does these things will live by them.’” In other words, the
righteousness of the Law is fundamentally of the form “do <i>X</i> and
live,” for some command X (and by implication, “fail to do <i>X</i> and
die”).  The Law spells out its punishment in
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+18%3A20&version=ESV">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, “The soul who sins shall die,” echoed in
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A23&version=KJV">Romans 6:23</a>, “The wages of sin is death.” This if-then
structure is essential to the nature of any law, not just the
spiritual one. Even the speed limit is not a law just because it says
“Don’t drive over sixty.” It’s a law because it says, “<i>If</i> you
drive over sixty, <i>then</i> you will get a fine.”  Without a
consequent, what you have is a suggestion or recommendation or
something, but not a law. And it’s important to keep this precise
definition in mind, because otherwise we end up thinking things like
“the Law is repeated in the New Testament” <a id="reference-4" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>,
or “Jesus kept the Law” <a id="reference-5" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>, or some
such thing, and the entire system of doctrine of the New Testament
collapses.

</p><p>So with the right definition in mind, it should make sense that the
Law has nothing to say to Christians, as the very thing that makes the
Law a “law,” namely the penalty of death, was already spent on Christ,
and is incapable of being applied to us now.  And the rest of the
scripture confirms this wonderful&#8288;—&#8288;but yes, strange&#8288;—&#8288;state of
affairs. Paul writes, for example, “Likewise, my brothers, you also
have died to the law through the body of Christ [...] <sup class="superscript">6</sup>[and] now
we are released from the law, having died to that which held us
captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the
old way of the written code” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A4-6&version=NKJV">Romans 7:4-6</a>).
Obviously, the Law does not speak to the dead; the dead are no longer
under the Law’s <i>juris-diction,</i> which word comes from two Latin
components literally meaning “law-speak.”  Who ever heard of putting a
dead man on trial?  Furthermore, how could that which is not of faith
(“and the law is not of faith,” <a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A12&version=ESV">Galatians 3:12</a>) have
anything to add to us, to whom “whatsoever is not of faith is sin”
(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+14%3A23&version=KJV">Romans 14:23</a>)?  That’s worth saying again: whatsoever
is not of faith is sin, and the Law&#8288;—&#8288;remember, “<i>do</i> thus and so
for righteousness”&#8288;—&#8288;is not of faith. This <i>doing</i> of the Law is
the very opposite of faith, because the opposite of faith is fact:
“Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things
not seen” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%3A1&version=NKJV">Hebrews 11:1</a>). So if you can see it (like
you can see me <i>doing</i> the Law), then it’s not “of faith.”  The
righteousness we have in Christ, on the other hand, is actually
invisible because it’s in the future. For now, I still look like a
sinner to an uninformed observer <a id="reference-6" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>. Paul
says that we “eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we
hope” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A5&version=NIV">Galatians 5:5</a>). And if we hope for righteousness,
then we certainly don’t possess it already, because “hope that is seen is
no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have?”
(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A24&version=NIV">Romans 8:24</a>). Yet God calls those things which are not
as though they were (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A17&version=NIV">4:17</a>), and bids me do the
same, right in the middle of my squalor. It is for this reason that I
can say, “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,
but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I
live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself
for me” <a target="_blank" href="https://studybible.info/AKJV/Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</a>.

</p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A4&version=KJV"><p>Galatians 5:4</a> says, “Christ is become of no effect unto
you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from
grace,” and the statement in (𝟙) is a readymade for defying the
gravity of the Law. Any attempts to reintroduce elements of the
Law&#8288;—&#8288;which attempts are often disguised to sound well-meaning and
reasonable to our Law-based sensibilities, e.g. “Well, if so-and-so
were <i>really</i> a Christian, then they wouldn’t have done that,” or
the perennial favorite, “repent and <i>turn</i> from your sins, sister,
and God will forgive you”&#8288;—&#8288;should be countered flatly with a
recitation of (𝟙).

</p>&nbsp;
<p>The second tool <a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=NKJV">Romans 3:19</a> equips us with concerns the
purpose of the Law: “whatever the law says, it says ... that every
mouth may be <i>stopped</i>, and all the world may become <i>guilty</i>
before God.” We already learned that the Law only speaks to those
under the Law, not to Christians. But this part informs us that, even
when it’s speaking to non-Christians, (𝟚) <b>the Law says what it says
it to condemn you before God.</b> In other words, the Law’s purpose is to
bring its audience to muted guilt for their sins against it. But,
critically, Paul uses the words “<i>whatever</i> the law says.” This
means that condemnation is not just one of several purposes of the
Law, but rather it is the Law’s one and only purpose. This leads us to
state that (𝟚.𝕒) <b>the Law has no other purpose than to condemn you.</b>

</p><p>This second axiom contradicts the designation of the Law as a “curb”
to restrain the evil in the world. This in itself is rather bizarre;
doesn’t God want me to do good? But as if that weren’t enough, it
turns out that the whole purpose of the Law from the very beginning
was actually to make sin abound! “Now the law entered in, that sin
might abound...”  (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A20&version=DRA">Romans 5:20</a>, first part). Far from
being a bane to evil, the Law is actually the strength of sin!  “The
sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1
Corinthians+15%3A56&version=NKJV">1
Corinthians 15:56</a>). Paul describes the dire state of affairs
in Romans 7:

</p><div class="scripture-block-quote"><div><sup class="laligned superscript">7</sup>What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it
had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not
have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall not
covet.”</div><div><sup class="laligned superscript">8</sup>But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in
me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead.</div><div><sup class="laligned superscript">9</sup>I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment
came, sin came alive and I died.</div><div><sup class="laligned superscript">10</sup>The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.</div><div><sup class="laligned superscript">11</sup>For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me
and through it killed me.</div><div class="quote-attrib"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A7-11&version=ESV">Romans 7:7-11</a>, ESV</div></div>

<p>So there is no answer to “Doesn’t God want me to do good?”  because
the question itself is fallacious. “Good” is a property of a
<i>person</i> which is inherited by their actions, not a property of the
actions inherited by the person. And this property is lost on the
first sign of evil manifesting in you, because if you break a single
part of the Law, you’re guilty of all: “For whoever keeps the whole
law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it”
(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A10&version=ESV">James 2:10</a>). Nothing can be done to restore goodness,
and attempting to do so only magnifies how far short you have fallen
of perfection. The Law is what does this magnification: “...in order
that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might
become sinful beyond measure” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A13&version=ESV">Romans 7:13</a>). Its sole
and simple purpose is to indict and convict you for the capital
offense of being a sinner. The Law never speaks to you to tell you
that you are correct or righteous, because you are never correct or
righteous; nor does it speak to you to convince you to change, because
you can never change. It hears no excuses, it brooks no defenses, it
gives no second chances, it accepts only guilty silence. Its only goal
is to crush all hope of keeping it, so that you perceive the reality
of your situation and stop searching for righteousness inside
yourself. Its singular aim is to finally wring out of you, after all
your best attempts have failed, one last cry, one last desperate gasp
for air: “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body
of this death?”  (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A24&version=NKJV">7:24</a>).

</p><p>But in a strange and wonderful twist, God transformed what would have
been our sure damnation into an integral part of the mechanism for our
salvation: “...where sin abounded, grace did more abound”
(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A20&version=DRA">Romans 5:20</a>, second part)! So the sequence is this:
where the Law is strong, sin abounds. But where sin abounds, grace
superabounds. And where grace superabounds, love abounds; for who is
forgiven much loves much, and who is forgiven little loves little
(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+7%3A47&version=ESV">Luke 7:47</a>). This journey from Law to sin to grace to
love is the road that every Christian takes to Christ. Look at Paul:
Pharisee of Pharisees, of the tribe of Benjamin, circumcised the
eighth day, zealous persecutor of the Church, defender of the Law. But
the harder he worked to keep the Law, the more material Sin had to use
against him (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A7-24&version=ESV">Romans 7:7-24</a>). This alone compelled him to
listen when Christ came calling. And for this critical
role it plays in our salvation, Paul gave the Law a new name in
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A24-25&version=KJV">Galatians 3:24-25</a>: “the law was our schoolmaster to
bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.” Then he
adds, “But after that faith is come, <i>we are no longer under a
schoolmaster”</i> (emph. added). When it comes to the Law, our only hope
is to die, so that we can be raised with Christ.

</p><p>Someone might say that the Law doesn’t actually create the sin, it
just shows you what’s already there. And that’s where I do agree with
the Lutheran viewpoint. The Law does make a superb mirror to show you
how wretched you are: “for by the Law is the knowledge of sin”
(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A20&version=NKJV">Romans 3:20</a>). The mirror doesn’t create the dirt you
see on your face, of course. But this doesn’t change the fact that the
mirror has only one function. Any restraint from evil this produces in
you is an accident, and insofar as it fosters any sense of
accomplishment or righteousness, it is actually contrary to the Law’s
stated purpose. The Law is not your friend: “for the law works wrath”
(<a target="_blank" href="https://studybible.info/AKJV/Romans 4:15">4:15</a>). Dante wrote that above the gates of Hell
the words are inscribed, <span class="smallcaps">All hope abandon, ye who enter here.</span> But
these words are perhaps just as appropriate for the entrance to the
temple of the Law.

</p><p>(𝟚) is useful any time people try to use the Law for the wrong
thing. For example, some people think that the Ten Commandments should
be used as a political device, to guide lawmakers and to stand watch
over our courthouses and state capitol buildings (see
<a id="reference-7" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>,
<a id="reference-8" href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>,
<a id="reference-9" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>,
and many others). But the Law is not suitable for these purposes.  A
human court must sometimes find the defendant innocent, but the Law
always enters the same judgment: guilty.

</p><p>Another enlightening result of (𝟚), courtesy of <i>modus tollens</i>, is
that (𝟚.𝕓) <b>if what you’re hearing isn’t condemning you, then it
isn’t the Law.</b>  So when Jesus told the woman caught in the act of
adultery, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more”
(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A11&version=NKJV">John 8:11</a>), He can’t have been teaching the Law, as
His words weren’t condemning her. Similarly, when the scripture says,
“For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but
that the world through Him might be saved” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A17&version=NKJV">3:17</a>),
it tells us that Jesus didn’t come to deliver the Law, because the Law
only condemns. (It’s almost like Jesus said, “I didn’t come into the
world to condemn the world,” and the Law says, “I came into the world
to condemn the world!”)

</p>&nbsp;
<p>The third tool we find in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=NKJV">Romans 3:19</a> is a bit more niche, but no less
powerful than the others. Principle (𝟙) states that the Law speaks
only to those under it. But, we might ask, who is under it? The verse
reads, “whatever the law says, it says ... that <i>every</i> mouth may be
stopped, and <i>all the world</i> may become guilty before God.” Since
Paul uses the words “all the world,” we can infer that (𝟛) <b>everyone
begins under the Law.</b> That is to say, everyone feels compunction by
the condemnation of the Law, so that no one can claim ignorance.

</p><p>This one might seem less revolutionary than our previous
discussions. But (𝟛) is nicely suited for understanding how we, as
completely sinful human beings, can even comprehend or think valuable
the good and holy things God offers us. Some say that we are incapable
of doing so, that humanity lives by default in a state of “total
depravity,” unable to even desire salvation until we are individually
selected by God and receive the desire to believe from Him. But I
think what they miss is that, while we are indeed depraved, we also
have the work of the Law written on our
hearts. <a target="_blank" href="https://studybible.info/AKJV/Romans 2:14-15">Romans 2:14-15</a> says, “For when the Gentiles,
which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law,
these, having not the law, are a law to themselves: <sup class="superscript">15</sup>Which show
the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also
bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else
excusing one another.” In other words, even unsaved non-Jews, who
weren’t directly given the Ten Commandments by God like the Jews,
still know right from wrong. They and we, both Jew and non-, have the
requirements of the Law written on the heart, if not on tablets of
stone; and we all demonstrate this by making moral accusations
(usually of others) and excuses (usually for ourselves). Not everyone
has the exact same laws, not everyone’s conscience pricks them for the
same things. They differ across countries, cultures, religions, and
even periods of time. But everyone has the <i>work</i> of the Law, that
essential “Do <i>X</i> or else, don’t do <i>Y</i> or else.”  The contents
don’t matter; it’s the form that’s the same. We always end up accused,
one way or another.

</p><p>So the Law is actually the bridge between us, who are carnal, and God,
who is spiritual. Despite the facts that “there is none righteous, no,
not one” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A10&version=NKJV">Romans 3:10</a>), and that, “in my flesh there
dwells no good thing” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A18&version=NKJV">7:18</a>), we still have this
piece stuck inside us&#8288;—&#8288;“written on our hearts”&#8288;—&#8288;which is
itself spiritual: “We know that the law is spiritual; but I am
unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A14&version=NIV">7:14</a>). This
piece acts as the “sensor” that attunes us to the offer of the
Gospel. It’s how we feel guilt, and how we even know we need a
savior. And according to (𝟛), that’s built into everyone, no special
selection from God required. If we give up this idea, then we also
have to abandon the idea that all the world will become guilty before
God according to the Law, because “sin is not imputed where there is
no law” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A13&version=NASB">5:13</a>), and “where there is no law there
is no transgression” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A15&version=NIV">4:15</a>). Therefore we must
rule in favor of (𝟛), that the Law is active in everyone, save those
in Christ (that is, in everyone except the dead).

</p><p>This understanding is reconfirmed by Christ himself, when he
instructed the disciples just before his ascension: “Go into all the
world and preach the gospel to every creature...”
(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16%3A15&version=NKJV">Mark 16:15</a>). The gospel “good news” is the solution to
a certain problem, which is that you are condemned by the Law. If we
are meant to offer the solution to that problem to “all the world,”
then we know that all the world already has that problem. Otherwise,
Christ would have had to charge us essentially with creating the
problem first by preaching the Law (because as we said, “sin is not
imputed where there is no Law” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A13&version=NASB">Romans 5:13</a>)), and then
preaching the gospel only afterward. So it makes no sense to say that
we should preach the Law to non-Christians, because all the world is
already laboring under it, per (𝟛). Now, people may react to the
accusations of the Law in different ways. Some people respond by
pointing out all the good they have done on the contrary, and
promising to do more. Others, by crying out for mercy. But everyone
has this spiritual sense nonetheless. For this reason we can earnestly
proclaim that Jesus died for the whole world, that God’s offer of
salvation is to everyone, that anyone who wants to be saved will be
saved, and we can be confident that the Law is attempting to prepare
people’s hearts to hear just this message. We just need to step back
and let the schoolmaster do its work <a id="reference-10" href="#footnote-10">[10]</a>.

</p>&nbsp;
<p>In conclusion, here are the statements we’ve been able to glean from
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=NKJV">Romans 3:19</a>:

</p><div class="customlist"><div><span class="laligned">𝟙)&nbsp;</span>The Law does not say anything whatsoever to those who are not
under it.</div>
<div><span class="laligned">𝟙.𝕒)&nbsp;</span>The Law has nothing whatsoever to say to Christians.</div>
<div><span class="laligned">𝟚)&nbsp;</span>The Law says what it says it to condemn you before God.</div>
<div><span class="laligned">𝟚.𝕒)&nbsp;</span>The Law has no other purpose than to condemn you.</div>
<div><span class="laligned">𝟚.𝕓)&nbsp;</span>If what you’re hearing isn’t condemning you, then it isn’t the
Law.</div>
<div><span class="laligned">𝟛)&nbsp;</span>Everyone begins under the Law.</div>
</div>

<p>As I’ve hoped to show, the verse is an essential scripture in anyone’s
repertoire. It compactly tells us not only to whom the law speaks, but
to whom it doesn’t speak; not only what the law says, but what it
doesn’t say. In sheer information density it’s nearly unparalleled,
and it sits at a busy intersection between so many of the strange and
alien ideas we find in the scriptures which seem so foreign to our
minds. Although it keeps a low profile, on the scale of usefulness it
ranks in with the likes of “God justifies the ungodly,” “I rejoice in
my infirmities,” and “Faith works by love,” if not “The just shall
live by faith.” These are all certainly words to keep close at hand.
