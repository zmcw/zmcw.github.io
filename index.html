<p>Hi, this is a website where I keep some notes.

</p><h2><p>Essays</h2>

</p><p>These are some longer essays I have written.

</p><ul><li><a href="/chr/romans319-v2.html">The Surprising Usefulness of Romans 3:19</a>: Commentary on the implications of Romans 3:19.</li>
</ul>


<h2><p>Listicles</h2>

</p><p>As much as I hate the word listicle, it’s what they are.

</p><ul><li><a href="/poetry.html">Poetry & Songs</a>: A few beautiful unrelated songs and poems (which I didn’t write) that I want to remember.</li>
<li><a href="/words.html">Word List</a>: A collection of satisfying words and definitions.</li>
</ul>
